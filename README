it makes you an archive of links.
the links can go out to other
websites or point inward.  mirrored
html pages are put between a common
header and footer and link back to
the archive index.  that's about
all it does, and that is why it is
so little.

i do not expect anyone to use this
but the maintainer of _why's estate.
and if i ever hand over that
position, i totally expect the new
maintainer to switch over to
something else, as they would have
to be crazy to try and pick through
this codemess.

_why's estate can be reached at:
http://viewsourcecode.org/why

               ~~~

ok, perhaps a basic explanation is
in order.

so here's the usage:

  $ ruby estate.rb why why_out

in this case, 'why' is the directory
with the source files, and 'why_out'
is the directory that will be
created and filled with the output
html files ready to be viewed in a
browser.

estate.rb has three main jobs:

  1. copy the exact directory
     structure and all unrecognized
     files within the source
     directory to the destination
     directory.
  2. use 'config.rb' and 'index.rb'
     and (if they exist) 'header.html'
     and 'footer.html' to create an
     index.html file which contains
     the list of links in the archive.
     the two ruby files must be in the
     source directory.
  3. each file whose name ends in
     '.src.html' and who is *exactly*
     one level deep in the directory
     structure (i.e. inside a direct
     subdirectory of the source
     directory) will be renamed to a
     '.html' (without the '.src') and
     its contents will be wrapped in
     between the contents of
     'header.html' and 'footer.html',
     if they exist.  a link going back
     to index.html will also be placed
     at the top.

the data structure of index.rb's LIST
is probably not ideal, i know.  i
started with nested hashes but found
that they got the ordering messed up,
and the ordering is important here. so
i switched to arrays.  and now my code
is full of staples.

so you can pretty much figure out how
it works yourself by looking at the
example of 'why/index.rb'.  but let me
point out a few things that might not
be obvious.

  - when you see ['desc', 'Blah blah'],
    that's a special item that causes
    a paragraph to be written above that
    section, in this case "Blah blah".
  - when you see ['quiet'], it's
    another special item which stops any
    external links in that section from
    showing their domain name on the
    right.
  - the final special item is
    ['horizontal'], which causes the
    links in that section to be displayed
    beside each other separated simply by
    a space, rather than each having
    their own bullet in the list.
  - links can be internal (local) or
    external. URLs starting with "http://"
    are external, and URLs starting with
    "estate://" are internal, and are
    relative to the output directory.
  - footnotes are totally separate in
    terms of data structures from the
    index.  they have their own constant,
    NOTES, and come after LIST.  it's like
    they're an afterthought, which is what
    footnotes should be, no?  so how it
    works is it's a hash where the keys
    are the names of sections or link text
    in LIST, and values are the
    corresponding notes on that list item.
    obviously there could very possibly be
    name collision problems here, but i
    won't worry about that until it
    happens.  i'll probably just work
    around it with a stupid hack, like
    putting an invisible space after the
    name or something.

some final miscellaneous notes:

  - 'config.rb' contains the title and
    description of the archive.  the
    description will be simply printed
    as a paragraph below the title on
    the index page.
  - 'header.html' and 'footer.html' are
    used to wrap the index.html file
    and any .src.html files in a common
    header and footer.  in 'header.html',
    all occurrences of '{title}' will be
    replaced with the title of the
    archive in index.html, or the title
    of the archive plus the title of
    the current page in .src.html files.
    the title of a .src.html file is
    gleaned from the first occurrence of
    an <h1> tag in the file.  so each
    .src.html file should have a title
    at the top wrapped in <h1> ... </h1>.
    also, any occurrences of '{dir}' in
    'header.html' will be replaced with
    the empty string in index.html, or
    '../' in .src.html files since they
    are required to be exactly one level
    deep in the directory structure.  i
    use this to refer relatively to the
    css file for _why's estate.

sorry about the length and detail of all
this.  maybe somebody will be helped.
probably me.
