TITLE = '_why\'s Estate'

DESCRIPTION = <<html
Hey, welcome to my collection of <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why the lucky stiff</a> links.  Everything _why has published on the internet should be accessible from here.  It works sort of like a museum that sells maps.  Many of his abandoned writings are mirrored locally here, and everything else is through external links.  To download the Estate perhaps for local viewing, get <a href="https://github.com/yjerem/estate/archive/master.zip">why.zip</a> (5.8 MB).
