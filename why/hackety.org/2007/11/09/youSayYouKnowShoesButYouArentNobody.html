  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rcoder/1913364624/"><img src="../../../images/nks-rcoder.jpg" class="rb" alt="" /></a></p><p>The question is: do they go by Moccasinos or Sneaksters?  Or just plain Loafers, I suppose.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on in the serfdom of Shoes:</p><ul>
	<li>Hacked $3 off on Nobody Knows Shoes.  It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1376595">budget</a> product.</li>
	<li>Phil Crissman is working on a <a href="http://philcrissman.com/2007/11/09/some-twittering-with-ruby-and-shoes/">Twitter shoe</a>.  Yeah, definitely, it&#8217;s time for some cohesive programs.</li>
	<li>Thanks are due from the <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/timeline">changeset</a>.  To <strong>bb</strong> in #shoes for helping me fix up win32 threading. And to <strong>Harold Hausman</strong> for suddenly having it occur to him that a certain oft-allocated bitmap wasn&#8217;t being freed.</li>
</ul><p>As for the rest of you: did you get your books?  Can you actually read the words?  I am somewhat worried about darkness.  At the end of the stacks and flow section.  Maybe even the background and border page.</p><p>(<em>Image up-top courtesy of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rcoder/1913364624/">rcoder</a>.</em>)</p>

    <div class="content"><p>The last lines on page 14 <em>are</em> difficult to make out. It looks like: &#8220;So flows hit the ?? and move down!&#8221; But that&#8217;s pretty hard to make out. I&#8217;m guessing `??` is&#8230; &#8220;edge&#8221;?</p><p>The background pages look fine&#8230; unless there&#8217;s some secret text I&#8217;m missing. &lt;:)</p><p>&#8220;working on&#8221; is the appropriate term for the Twitter shoe. (&#8216;Shwitter&#8217;? &#8230;perhaps not.) We&#8217;ll see if the weekend proves profitable for Shoes &amp; Twitter hacking.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Mine arrived earlier this week.  I inhaled it twice, partially out of just a joy of reading and experiencing, and partially to soak in the knowledge.  I wish all libs were so entertaining, yet well thought out.</p><p>I did run into some lockup issues&#8230; but I suspect the patch above addresses that?</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>So, to all of you out there, is it completely bothersome to have to wait for this thing?  Would you have preferred just having a free PDF?  Or do you like having the real, tangible thing first?</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>I don&#8217;t like waiting, usually, but I have been taught how to do it well by the world&#8217;s slowbies.  I don&#8217;t mind either way, but if it&#8217;s meant to be a book, not a PDF, then I&#8217;ll wait. (ordering mine now)</p><p>agreeing with hadley also&#8230;don&#8217;t sell yourself short.  It&#8217;s not the money, it&#8217;s the image of what the product gives for $5.57 vs $8.72 vs #{&quot;$13.%d&quot; % rand(100)}.</p><p>On second thought, maybe it&#8217;s not such a good idea <em>in the first place</em> to <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/">put a price</a> on what you make yourself.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>I spent the last week anticipating NKS, and got giddy when it arrived in the mail today. When it arrived, I downloaded Shoes onto my laptop and immediately gathered every ethernet and phone cable in the house so that I wouldn&#8217;t get distracted by the Internet.</p><p>My neighbor Thomas helped me weave a hammock from the cable. This made a comfortable place where I was able to learn Shoes. Thumbs up on the comic book and thanks for the inspiration!</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>It didn&#8217;t really take very long for me to get the book, and my eyes are much happier to get to look at paper once in a while.</p><p>I&#8217;d buy a book of scribbles if it had ruby code hidden in it. In fact, it&#8217;d be great if the next book didn&#8217;t even have a real theme other than just being snippets of code to type out and discover, a la old BASIC code in old computer magazines.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Just got my copy today&#8211;amazing!  High-fives all around, I love NKS.  I, for one, eagerly waited for the printed copy and would also have willingly shelled out more for this gem (no pun intended) in and of itself, and also to support all the awesomeness you&#8217;ve made before.</p><p>I&#8217;d very likely do the same for a printed copy of the poignant guide, and it&#8217;s essentially a done deal if it contained some bonus action.</p><p>Woo Shoes!</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Well I just placed my order for the cheap version of the book. Had you actually charged a real price to earn some dollars I would have paid more just fine. Oh vells.</p><p>But I still would rather get a pdf first still caause I dont have to wait, and pdfs are easy to search. print is great after words but please release a pdf to the customers that have paid. http://www.flexiblerails.com/ did the same deal with lulu but had the beta book system in pdf and that was great.</p></div>
