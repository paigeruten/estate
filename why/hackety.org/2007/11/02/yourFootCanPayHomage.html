  <div class="author">by why</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Here&#8217;s one that got left out of <em>Nobody Knows Shoes</em>.  Doing a bunch of true shoe parallels just felt too broad.  But, anyway, the idea is to teach stacks and flows by also teaching how to lace shoes in <a href="http://labaq.com/archives/50791577.html">different styles</a> which resemble each box type.  You can vote stacks and flows with your feet.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/lace-ladder.jpg" class="rb" alt="" /></p>
<p>See here: the Ladder closely resembles a <strong>stack</strong>.  And, while you&#8217;re lacing it, kids, notice how each box in the ladder goes out of its way to stay independent.  The laces cross over the bridge of the shoe in a very orderly style.</p>
<p>Right, and when you use stacks, all your images and paragraphs and things neatly go.  Top to bottom.</p>
<p><br clear="all" /></p>
<p><img src="../../../images/lace-sawtooth.jpg" class="rb" alt="" /></p>
<p>It seemed to me, the sawtooth is a fine way of thinking about <strong>flows</strong>.  You&#8217;re still going top-to-bottom, but the laces kind of weave left-to-right as they go.</p>
<p>And I guess evading stacks and flows, using coordinates directly, would be like a slip-on shoe or something.  Or having gum stuck on your shoe.  I don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t ask me.</p>
<hr />

<p>Anyways, a few years ago I visited my aunt.  Her family calls her &#8220;Big Mol&#8221; even though she&#8217;s really all wispy.  She&#8217;s a dedicated and bookthirsty librarian.  Her personal shelves are all Bliss (BC2) or something.  Anyway, she saw how I was tying my shoes, which was a very primitive rabbit-round-the-tree style and she gently took me through the <a href="http://www.shoelaceknot.com/shoelace/turquoiseturtleknot.htm">turquoise turtle knot</a>.</p>
<p>Seriously, it&#8217;s a good knot.  Thanks, Big Mol!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Holy moley, I had no idea that there was a website devoted to shoelace knots nor that such a thing was theoretically possible. I am totally printing some of these out and giving them a shot. Thanks. You may have changed my life, _why.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Thank you for pointing me to that knot!  I&#8217;ve seen those tidy double-wrapped laces everywhere and been envious of whoever had tied them.</p><p>Yeah, it might have been neat to put in the book, though&#8230;</p></div>
