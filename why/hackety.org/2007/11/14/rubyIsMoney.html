<p><a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/12/Bad-Ruby">Tim Bray</a>: Look, dammit, Ruby isn&#8217;t an insurgency or a conspiracy or a party, it&#8217;s a profession and a vocation and we&#8217;re getting getting paid for doing it. So why the flaming hell are we meeting on weekends like Trekkies or scrapbookers?</p>
</blockquote>
#1 BEST DAD.<p>I saved all year to go to RubyConf.  Really, I did!  But I blew the money on a new clarinet.  What kind of person does that?  Gaa, I&#8217;m such a retard that way!!</p>
<hr />

<p>People, Ruby isn&#8217;t a game.  It isn&#8217;t a hobby.  It&#8217;s certainly not a very good food source and it&#8217;s not an article of clothing.  You can&#8217;t just put Ruby in the wash with a load of whites.  Nice try, but no.  No.  Jeez, grow a brain.  Ruby isn&#8217;t a tambourine you can bang loudly in my ear.  I&#8217;m trying to use my iPhone here, guy.</p>
<p>And Ruby is not some bachelor&#8217;s party with a foxy lady in a sherlock holmes hat.  Hardly: Ruby is all dads.  Put a petticoat on, woman.  Pop those balloons.  We&#8217;re all getting paid here and we&#8217;re all having kids here.  Get with the program.</p>
<p>Ruby is serious business.  Real business and totally bankable.  Fact: You cannot do it late at night.  The office is closed during those hours.   You should be in bed like all the other dads.  Now, have a nightcap and go put your PJs on, we&#8217;ve got to wake up early tomorrow, it&#8217;s pancake day.</p>
<p>Ruby requires your curriculum vitae, notarized and sealed in a tamper-proof envelope, on its desk by midnight tomorrow.  Do not screw it up.  You won&#8217;t get paid to go to RubyConf.</p>
<p>You see, it&#8217;s so simple.  Relax, enjoy your family.  Heck, play Nerf swords with them, if you want to.  But be a dad.  Get paid.  Punch the clock.  Write your employer some sensational code.  That&#8217;s how Ruby works.  We don&#8217;t need an insurgency.  Star Wars needed an insurgency.  But they didn&#8217;t have any good dads back then.  Vader was a bad dad.  We have plenty of great dads getting paid!  We&#8217;re covered.  We&#8217;re quite bankable.</p>
<p>So, yeah, alright, #1 <span class="caps">BEST</span> <span class="caps">DAD</span>.  And, as Dad says, &#8220;Okay, troops!  L-L-Let&#8217;s getta move on!&#8221;</p>

    <div class="content"><p>i&#8217;d like to have an employer that would pay me to go to ruby-related events, but somehow that would make it less fun and more like business (which it clearly is, as I get paid to do it)</p><p>that said, i like my dad, and he doesn&#8217;t have to make pancakes on pancake day for me to be happy. he just has to play catch every once in awhile, and help wash the dog with tomato juice when the dog decides to launch his own insurgency against small woodland creatures.</p><p>this is how i feel, and even tim bray can&#8217;t change how i feel about my dad. or the dog.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Great post, and I love you too, _why (strictly platonic, like a dad even).  Ruby doesn&#8217;t need an insurgency.  It&#8217;s just the right thing to do, and yes, it&#8217;s time to come out and admit our dad-ness and that some of us <strong>do</strong> get paid to write Ruby all day.</p></div>

Tim Bray sure is a prick for daring to say that he prefers spending time with his kids to chilling with WACKY NERDS and their KERAZY NON SEQUITURS!

    <div class="content"><p>Sun is the company that pays Tim a big salary at the end of each months. So he writes what they want him to. In this case Sun&#8217;s executives are a little bit worried about their strategy.</p><p>Remember why Sun marketeers (and Tim) promote Ruby:</p><p>1. Ruby on Rails sucks less than the established J2EE web framework (that&#8217;s kind of easy) and Sun desperately needs a popular web programming environment.</p><p>2. Unlike Python&#8217;s (which has had a JVM implementation since 1998), the original Ruby&#8217;s VM sucks enough not to compete with Sun&#8217;s own Java VM.</p><p>The trouble with this &#8220;worse is better&#8221; strategy is that it worked very well and has now materialized in the form of an army of proud Java morons wreaking havoc in Ruby&#8217;s community.</p></div>

Halloween falls on Friday next year, so you might want to get a head start on the your rant for when someone schedules something during the week. Maybe you could write it in XML-encoded UTF-32 Klingon, with each individual byte nested inside about 50 levels of useless, anal-retentive markup. That would rock! As well as getting you Major Geek Cred!</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Hey tom, I got a totally different meaning from Tim&#8217;s post.  I thought he was daring to say that he prefers working insane hours to spending time with his kids.  Good news though is that so much of the conf world is made available, for free even!, through things like confreaks.  So instead of giving up his weekends, he can spend 9 a.m. through 3 p.m. on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday watching all the recorded videos.  Choices are great!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></div>
