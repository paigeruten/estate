  <div class="content"><p><img src="../../../images/shoes-book-in-cursive.png" class="c" title="The latter half of August is ALWAYS the do-your-code-in-cursive half." alt="The latter half of August is ALWAYS the do-your-code-in-cursive half." /></p>
<p>So Shoes is for writing desktop apps.  But the deal was that Shoes was supposed to be <strong>more like the web</strong> than regular desktop appy wares.  Hmm?  How so?</p>
<p>Well, a big reason is that every window inside a Shoes app has a path (a <span class="caps">URL</span>.)  If you&#8217;re writing a simple app, then that window is simply the root window and you don&#8217;t need to think about URLs.  Only if your app jumps around between windows.</p>
<p>And, so, why does Shoes bother using URLs?  Well, I found that URLs came in really handy when I was writing Hackety Hack the first time around.  Basically, the <span class="caps">URL</span> lets you refer to a window by a string, which is great if you need to save place.  Hackety Hack has an interactive tutorial that walks around the app and saving the <span class="caps">URL</span> of a window ended up saving me a lot of time.</p>
<p>And making a page of links becomes as simple as it is on the web.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/browser/trunk/samples/book.rb?rev=117">samples/book.rb</a>:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/shoes-book.png" class="c" alt="" /></p>
<p>However, even though I&#8217;m using URLs, I&#8217;m not using <span class="caps">HTTP</span> methods like <span class="caps">GET</span> or <span class="caps">POST</span>.  I&#8217;m not sure if they have their place yet.  I know these verbs are a big deal right now, but I&#8217;m not sure I see them being as potent in Shoes, you know?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Are these really URLs? The U in URL is &#8220;universal&#8221; but these &#8220;resource locators&#8221; seem to be &#8220;relative&#8221; to your application.</p><p>I think you have an RRL!</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Cool idea! How about instead of using HTML for the formatting, to instead use Markaby, or similar? Less typing, plus would be in keeping with the program structure.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m not sure if using HTTP&#8217;s verbs would necessarily be good either, but if you&#8217;re promoting accessible hacking (in the sense of &#8216;accessible to every skill level&#8217;) I wonder if designing the app so that you&#8217;re exposing the same set of verbs for all classes would be good? IOW, follow a Resource Oriented Architecture&#8212;just not on http&#8230;</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>At my job I&#8217;ve stumbled on a similar pattern.  We want to make contextual help easy to generate and easy to take folks from place to place in our application.</p><p>We&#8217;re going to be emulating urls for the different control panes in our app.  I think the metaphor can be extended to also reference each control through maybe a query string.<br>
So pane://add_stocks?new_symbol_text=GOOG&amp;price_override_text=10.50 could send you to a new part of the app and help fill in the values of various fields.  How to handle more complex things?  More complex urls?</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>This is starting to sound more and more like HyperCard, at least in the the metaphors.  In HyperCard, there was a stack of cards, their uri was essentially a card index number.  This seems like a very good idea to me, it gives a clear means of traversing from one piece of an application to another.</p></div>
