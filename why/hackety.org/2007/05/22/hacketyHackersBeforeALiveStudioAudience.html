Three talks from gentlemen who were among the original fifty Hackety Hackers.  This here is Eric Mill coding a chat application.  This talk is just ramshackle and fun, especially since the audience subverts his chat in a really damned gleeful way.  I also like this talk because it reveals a bunch of shortcomings to H-ety H that I hadn&#8217;t seen yet.  Oh, I&#8217;ve much to do!</p><p>The other talks are great, too. <strong>Part one: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1711561897321228308&hl=en">Kevin Driscoll&#8217;s talk</a></strong> about how he went about teaching Python to his high school kids.  And <strong>part two: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6471035934444708692">Brian DeLacey&#8217;s overview</a></strong> of what we&#8217;re shooting for and how he&#8217;s been teaching his kids.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I don&#8217;t think regexes can or should be slain&#8212;but perhaps we can find a better syntax.  Brevity in regular expressions is overrated.</p><p>Someone want to try writing a library to make this work?</p><pre>Regexp.build do

    <div class="content"><p>I think a more readable syntax is what yerejm meant, Mental, not removing them altogether.  I really like the block approach.  I wonder if you could do simple stuff in a line though, with a special string?</p><p>string.match(&#8220;starts with &#8216;gordon&#8217;, has any letters or numbers, has one &#8216;@&#8217;, has many letters or numbers, has one &#8216;.&#8217;, ends with many lowercase letters&#8221;)<br>
=&gt; string.match(/^gordon[a-zA-Z0-9]*@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[a-z]+$/)</p><p>This would match emails starting with &#8220;gordon&#8221;.  I think this grammar is actually parsable.</p></div>

      23th</strong>
    14:02</div>
    <div class="content"><p>It&#8217;s parseable, but I&#8217;ve learned to strongly dislike attempts at &#8220;natural language&#8221; programming because they create false expectations.  People get repeatedly drawn to try things which are entirely natural in English but fall outside of the small subset the synthetic language corresponds to, so they&#8217;re effectively punished for experimenting.</p><p>[In terms of specific experiences, I would have to say the <em>least unsuccessful</em> example of a &#8220;natural language&#8221; approach is Inform 7, but even there I find it becomes very frustrating to learn until you finally internalize the limits of its pidgin.]</p><p>Contrast that with Ruby, where generalizing from examples is likely to lead to pleasant surprises, rather than a smack on the hand and violated expectations.  That&#8217;s one of the things that makes Ruby so fun in the first place, isn&#8217;t it?</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>HH has a few methods like <code>String#starts?</code> and <code>String#ends?</code> and <code>String#remove</code> that I think help the situation a bit.

    <div class="content"><p>I&#8217;m always amazed that ruby doesn&#8217;t have String#starts? and String#ends? methods.  I think mental actually has a reasonable idea.  It could probably even be a lot more succinct.  Maybe I&#8217;ll play with something tonight :)</p></div>

    14:00</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I like MenTaLguY&#8217;s example.</p><p>But perhaps the <code>exactly</code> operator is redundant?</p><p>And could we assign captured stuff to variables directly? Using magic <code>$n</code> variables is succinct but a bit implicit, and especially confusing when there are lots of nested captures to index.</p><pre>

    15:56</div>
    <div class="content"><p><b>Anthony</b>: maybe it could return a subclass of MatchData which would define accessors for the match names.</p><p>Something like: <code>capture(:named_thing){&#8230;}</code> or <code>capture_many(:other_things){&#8230;}</code>.</p><p>Which could then be used:<br>
<code>result = built_expression.match(&#8220;Some text&#8221;)</code><br>
<code>result.named_thing</code> =&gt; some match<br>
<code>result.other_things</code> =&gt; array of stuff</p><p>It&#8217;s a little more explicit, and somewhat less magic.</p></div>

    14:58</div>
    <div class="content"><p>If you&#8217;re trying to assign to a variable, why not use assignment?<br>
<code><br>
named_thing = capture {zero_or_more {any_char_from &#8220;a&#8221;..&quot;f&quot;}}<br>
</code></p><p>And named_thing would be a scalar or an array, depending on whether 1 or more objects were found.</p></div>

    <h3>MenTaLguY</h3>
    <div class="time">said on <strong>May
      25th</strong>
    18:16</div>
    <div class="content"><p>I like <code>netghost</code>&#8217;s idea.</p><p>By way of contrast, using assignment with the call to capture directly won&#8217;t work, since <code>Regexp.build</code> is not evaluating the regexp, but constructing it, which may not even happen in the binding where you need to do the match (in fact, if you&#8217;re using this more expensive way to create a regexp, you almost certainly don&#8217;t want it to be!).  There are also problems if you need to nest the capture.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>_why, sorry to bother you on a blog post, but HH forums and other bits and bobs aren&#8217;t working for me and I wondered what&#8217;s wrong?  There isn&#8217;t a hint on the other parts of the HH site&#8230;</p><p>This sadly means some of the later HH leasons just fall down and die, is there something wrong at your end or mine?</p><p>Cheers<br>
