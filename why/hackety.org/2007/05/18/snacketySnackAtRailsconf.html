  <div class="content"><p>Here&#8217;s what Brian DeLacey (the H-ety H Chargé d&#8217;affaires) has to say about RailsConf:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For our BoF session on Saturday evening at 8:30, <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/rails2007/view/e_sess/14529">Hackety Hack and User Groups: Learning Ruby and Rails</a>, we&#8217;ve been told we &#8220;may welcome non-ticket holding sneak-ins.&#8221; We gladly extend the invitation to any Rubyists in the Portland area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, the Web is starting to pay more attention to our helpful little tool, but how can we start to really get it into the hands of youngsters?  Perhaps some dead-simple beginner&#8217;s classes could be injected into monthly meetups?  Maybe some Hackety Hack afterschool clubs?  Such is the topic tomorrow.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Just attended the BOF.  Several Observations/Ideas:</p><p>1) HacketyHack is a tremendous idea to get programming back into education! Congratulation to _why and all others involved!</p><p>2) To encourage Test Driven Development mindset/habits:<br>
    &#8211;Ruby Quiz for Kids with automated evaluation against a large set of test &amp; corner cases. <br>
    &#8211;Score heavily on complete/correct solutions. (TDD will excell)  <br>
    &#8211;Reward thoroughness &amp; excellence by posting high scores on HacketyHack or local sites</p><p>3) For adaptation and implementation in schools<br>
   &#8211;Establish a standardized curriculum<br>
   &#8211;Establish a standardized criteria for success<br>
   &#8211;Provide an automated scoring system.<br>
Note: Most educators will work to stay a few days ahead of their class.  They will not have the perspective or know enough to establish a curriculum in advance.</p><p>4) Everything in 3) above applies doubly for HomeSchooled kids. Self-paced learning for HomeSchooled kids is a big opportunity for HacketyHack.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><blockquote><p>&quot;To encourage Test Driven Development mindset/habits: &quot;</p></blockquote><p>We actually discussed BDD.. not so much TDD. Having a RSpec-like describe/it approach would likely be a more natural way to educate kids about specifying the behavior of the code that the problem they&#8217;re about to solve.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>I just wanted to say thanks to all the people who attended&#8211;with roots from Europe to Alaska and lots of places beyond and between. There was some great HH community energy, conversation, and creative thinking. Indeed, it was a fabulous group of people with a ton of practical and actionable ideas. I&#8217;ll summarize and share notes from the meeting and I sure look forward to similar gatherings in the future.</p></div>

We&#8217;re trying to get them hooked, not make them what grownup programmers should be.</p><p>Please let kids be kids and have fun exploring. Don&#8217;t start with the jargon culture with them just yet. Just a thought.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Here are some of the highlights from the Birds of a Feather Session on Hackety Hack at RailsConf.  The RailsConf <a href="http://www.slideyslide.com/bof/SlideySlideCoverPage.html">HH BoF slides</a> are available.</p><h1>Intro to session</h1><p>About 60 people attended, from all corners of the USA&#8211;sweeping from Alaska through Europe. There were a couple of teachers in the room – and each seemed very interested in the prospects of HH.  A few of the BoF attendees had tried HH with their kids. Some others were new to Ruby programming and going to give it a try for their own benefit.</p><p>About 20 of the attendees were involved with a user group of some sort and a half-dozen or so were affiliated with O’Reilly’s excellent User Group Program.</p><p>Most of the attendees appeared to be using Macs (TextMate&#8217;s stronghold on Rails editing!) Clearly, they were eager for a native build. Some of them were using VMWare or Parallels and running HH happily. There was also significant interest in Linux as well.</p><p>A majority of people in the room had used online &#8220;Try Ruby&#8221;. One attendee commented how amazed they were when HH suddenly hit the scene, mist-like appearing out of nowhere!</p><p>Eric Mill shared a number of insights on the technical underpinnings of HH. Eric also gave a pretty amazing demonstration of Hackety Hack after the session. His Boston-based HH demonstration on video is another example of his real-time hackery at work. Impressive stuff and surely worth a watch.</p><p>Andrea O. K. Wright discussed <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a>, an open sourced, powerful implementation of SmallTalk. Andrea walked through a demonstration of a simple-to-create object-oriented easy-to-animate drag-and-drop paint program. She showed a neat demonstration of the way that these animatable objects can be created in just a few minutes. (Andrea’s comments resonated nicely with the Avi Bryant&#8217;s keynote on SmallTalk and Ruby.)</p><h1>How did you get started in programming?</h1><p>We explored how people got started in programming. Many interesting pathways led to RailsConf. A number of attendees recalled a favorite high school teacher. Memorable programming assignments included challenging &#8220;outwit the teacher&#8221; assignments. The hugely imporant impact of teachers was evident from these long held memories.</p><p>Others talked about their programmable calculators, early Apples, and spritely machines from Texas Instruments. A couple of people almost simultaneously talked about the same “crazy” cyber-punk magazine that came with a bundled version of Basic. Neither recalled the name of the publication – so I don’t think it was a MAD Magazine of the digital age&#8211;but it seems like it might have deserved a Pulitzer prize for blending narrative and code.</p><p>Perhaps the future awaits a serialization of cartoon foxes bundled with Hackety Hack on thumb drives? If the cartoon foxes are busy, perhaps a long-awaited return of Bigelow will lead us forward?</p><p>For a few, Logo was an early inspiration – just making a little turtle dance can be a ton of fun they said. A few who told stories of friends who self-identified their programming talent late in life through standardized testing. There seemed also to be some related activities – like Lego Mindstorms – which offered inspiration equally to young girls and boys.</p><h1>Brainstorming</h1><p>A number of great ideas arose from the group’s brainstorming. Here are the ones I caught:</p><ul>
	<li>Get kids to enjoy act of programming</li>
	<li>A lesson server would be great – a way of distributing lessons to  a classroom</li>
	<li>Pool lesson development efforts and share across schools</li>
	<li>Is there a central server for posting programs and lessons?</li>
	<li>Create your own for youngin’s computer science guidelines (they don’t exist now)</li>
	<li>Establish feature / lesson spectrum across groups: 8 – 12, 12 – 14, 14 and up …</li>
	<li>Make a personal commitment – and create a mentoring opportunity – with a local school</li>
	<li>Series of spec driven program projects, which are goal-directed and game-like</li>
	<li>Create a RubyQuiz for kids;</li>
	<li>Have kids pair up – one writes a test, and challenges the other to break it</li>
	<li>Have a central server for posting programs and teaching lessons</li>
	<li>Is there a home called central.hacketyhack.net?</li>
</ul><h1>Tech Questions/Requests</h1><ul>
	<li>What about Linux and Mac? (_why’s ahead of the game on that one)</li>
	<li>How to create “libraries” for HH? Allowing one-line programs while “hiding” other code?</li>
	<li>How to create customized tutorials? How to modify/create tutorials? ls or create their own lessons/tutorials</li>
</ul><p>A sub-group of teachers is interested in developing a curriculum with lesson plans – let’s hope that activity self-organizes!</p><p>&#8211;Brian</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Ohh, that does it.  You&#8217;ve laid it all out!</p><p>One of my favorite ideas up there is the one about making your own lessons.  And beyond that: sharing those on the HH site.  All futuristic-like.</p><p>I will mention.  If you open up the <code>static/tutor.txt</code>, you&#8217;ll see that the interactive tutor uses a sort of wiki text.  I&#8217;ve still got some features to add, but I think I&#8217;m going to stick with that, although it will move into a locale folder (English, French, Russian and the like.)</p><p>Translations are coming together <a href="https://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hacketyhack/wiki/Translators">here</a>.</p></div>
