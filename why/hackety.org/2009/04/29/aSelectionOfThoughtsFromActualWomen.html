            <p>It would be totally presumptious and ridiculous for me to try to make the call on whether the dreaded <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/">GoGaRuCo incident</a> was offensive to female hackers. As it turns out: I&#8217;m not a woman, I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>
            <p>But I&#8217;ve been around for the aftermath, to witness that first-hand. (And I&#8217;m not going to make a judgement on that either, because I am <em>patently</em> wrong at all times.) However, I am going to steal this chance to quote as many of the lady Rubyists as I can find.</p>
            <p>I know everyone wants this topic to end. Go then. Or: stay and hear the feminine perspectives concentrated; we hear the other side quite enough. (And I definitely don&#8217;t deserve to talk as much as I do.)</p>

I breastfed. I&#8217;ve hunted. I even like porn! But two great tastes don&#8217;t always taste great together, and that is the point that so many seem to have failed to make, or to get.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/#comment-549">Amy Newell</a>: I understand that the ruby community prides itself on its un- or anti-professionalism. But some professional norms exist for very good reasons: because they make it easier for people of different backgrounds and life experiences to come together and work productively and respectfully. One doesn&#8217;t have to be an uptight square to suggest that aggressive displays of sexual content at programming conferences perhaps decrease, rather than increase the ability of those attending to learn and focus on the technology itself. Titillation is certainly good marketing, but frankly, if you can&#8217;t find a way to make your presentation interesting that doesn&#8217;t include thonged asses, your presentation isn&#8217;t interesting. Not everyone responds to tits and ass, but everyone can respond to honest, creative, intelligent command of the material and eagerness to share it.</p>

The weird shit is reflective of society as a whole and the tech industry in particular. Sometimes people are jerks. Sometimes nice people act like jerks. However, the cool stuff is genuine. The enthusiasm is infectious. It&#8217;s not just a love the latest whiz bang techno-goodie (although there is a lot of that); many folks are interested in contributing to something bigger, something that makes the world a better place, even in the kinds of small ways that software can sometimes help.</p>

You see it in job posts, how people talk about their work, and the way Rubyists rant on their blogs. It&#8217;s macho, it can be offputting to both genders, and it makes it easy in this kind of situation to say, &#8220;what&#8217;s your problem? I&#8217;m just busy being awesome&#8221;. It&#8217;s also a significant barrier to adoption for people who aren&#8217;t already a part of this culture, and don&#8217;t find it appealing.</p>

I, and many like me, have felt extremely uncomfortable in work situations because of the men I worked with &amp; their &#8220;macho jokes.&#8221; However, I don&#8217;t even really think that this particular issue is a women vs. men debate.

There are so many other things in nature and society that can be used it&#8217;s best to not bring sex into it because most people are uncomfortable in public because of it. I think my discomfort comes from the fact that we need to maintain a respectable attitude towards one another to get along and a lot of men have enough trouble seeing women as intellectual equals without a respected community expert or leader bringing those attitudes to everyone&#8217;s attention.</p>

I voted for it, actually, because CouchDB is one of those things that&#8217;s the new hotness and I haven&#8217;t had a chance to play with it, and besides, he wouldn&#8217;t actually put porn in the slides. Right? [&#8230;] I&#8217;m a minority in this community. I know that, and generally I can ignore it and go along thinking it&#8217;s a meritocracy of ideas and code. Then I encounter a woman&#8217;s thonged rear on the screen at a conference, 20 feet tall, and I remember, oh yeah, people like me don&#8217;t belong here. To most of these men around me, I am, at best, an oddity, and at worst, a sexual target. I feel a little less safe.</p>

We&#8217;ve just experienced words of technology &#8211; key phrases like scalability, <span class="caps">REST</span>, public interfaces &#8211; with images of women whom we&#8217;re told are available for visual sexual gratification. There are a few men in some of the images; they appear to me to be in positions of power and influence. The images of women, on the other hand, tend to be submissive. So we&#8217;re learning, subconsciously, that women associated with technology are also associated with sexual gratification and submissiveness. (The only strong women in the slideshow are associated with conflict, which we try to avoid.)</p>

In fact, by letting these things out in the open, we in the tech community should use this as a point of discussion and perhaps even chastising. It is difficult for men to examine their own privilege because it manifests itself in complicated ways. Men also have to be willing to listen critically to what others are saying.</p>

It is scary being &#8220;the only girl in your class,&#8221; and one of three in a room of fifty people. It&#8217;s scary to ask questions when you&#8217;re afraid your entire gender will be judged by your grasp of a concept. Asking girls to brave these situations because writing software is fun, and interesting, and exciting is a moot point when faced with these type of stories.</p>

It offended <strong>people</strong> &#8212; not women selectively or by any majority. See? It&#8217;s a slippery slope and we&#8217;d best err on the side of being open-minded, rather than calling for book (or slide, as it were) burnings.</p>

                <div class="content"><p>This is why I don&#8217;t go on freenode anymore except when I need help. I feel like I either have to hide my gender and pretend to be something I&#8217;m not, or I feel.. endangered. It is totally a boys club, and while the vast majority of guys on freenode and presumably at conferences like this are really great people, they always seem to be silent when stuff like this happens. It is a lonely, vulnerable feeling.</p>
            <p>I think you can all imagine, for a moment, if you had gone to a conference on womens rights, surrounded by feminists and regular women who mostly act like you are strange, unusual, giving you strange or surprised looks, watching a presentation littered with pornographic imagery of men as though they didn&#8217;t even expect you might be there&#8230; You&#8217;d probably feel uncomfortable. The difference of course is that you could leave without a second thought. Am I supposed to leave one of my creative passions because the community is full of sexist arseholes and men who don&#8217;t stand up against injustice?</p>
            <p>I don&#8217;t know, but more and more, I&#8217;m distancing myself from you guys. Female hackers are out there. We just aren&#8217;t at the conferences or the chat rooms. Eventually the sense of alienation builds greater and greater till we tend to just give up on it and do something else.. Web design, Illustration, Music&#8230; Something with a culture of caring and accepting. I will say this though, _why&#8217;s rooms on freenode have some of the nicest people in them that I&#8217;ve ever met. :)</p></div>

                <div class="content"><p>Thanks for sharing these. I&#8217;m kind of lost on this, not having been there for the presentation and not actively following the discussion.</p>
            <p>My initial response at the beginning was &#8220;Big fucking deal, I didn&#8217;t see anything offensive in the slides,&#8221; and I still don&#8217;t.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, that makes me sort of a bad guy; but I just don&#8217;t see the larger evil.</p>
            <p>I wish I were enlightened, and some of these comments are enlightening, I do now see moreso why it is legitimately a big deal.</p>
            <p>I am still conflicted by the &#8220;debacle&#8221;; ultimately, I don&#8217;t see the necessary connection to the lack of women in the Ruby/Rails community or in IT and this behavior. I think, to a degree, that a &#8220;focus to bring women into the community&#8221; sounds contrived, that natural curiosity or a normal introduction isn&#8217;t good enough.</p>
            <p>Let me clarify: I think it odd that we say that we need to &#8220;involve women in the community&#8221; (or anybody, for that matter) against their own volition. Isn&#8217;t it someone&#8217;s own choice and a bit of chance that introduces them into the community? (Perhaps this is why I&#8217;m not on the evangelism team, haha.)</p>
            <p>Or are we talking further, or more specifically, of creating a gender-neutral environment? Even so, if this were the case, I don&#8217;t quite see the value of arguing to curtail people&#8217;s behaviors beyond saying &#8220;I&#8217;m offended&#8221; or &#8220;that was offensive, please be considerate of my opinions,&#8221; except maybe to be clear what was offensive.</p>
            <p>I feel that I am dim on the topic, so I hope that my commentary here can engender an educational response from someone who can illuminate the topic.</p></div>

            <p>The &#8220;get over it&#8221; brigade seem, in large part, to be those who are as yet too emotionally immature to understand that their own sensibilities and sensitivities are not necessarily the perfect set and that people who do not share them are not defective because of this.

But I don&#8217;t give two shits about them: changing these people is near impossible, and I&#8217;m certainly not one to do it without a better understanding, at least. I&#8217;m curious, I want to be understanding and capable of helping change the attitude of the community, which means addressing this behavior as I come in contact with it (which, to be honest, hasn&#8217;t been much thus far). It may be simply that, for the most part, I don&#8217;t hang out with douchebags in the Ruby/Rails community, or am too oblivious to realize it. Hell, I could be a douchebag, though I don&#8217;t think I am <sup>_</sup></p>
            <p>@Jenna Thanks for the analogy, totally get that. Even a segregated team would be a little alienating. So the thing to take home is the challenge to make the community inclusive? Is this enough, or the right problem?</p>
            <p>I&#8217;ve worked with women before in the Ruby/Rails community, and I don&#8217;t think it was any different than when I work with men or any combination.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s both a blessing and a curse not having encountered blatant sexism or bigotry in our community, since it means that I&#8217;m either blind or unfamiliar enough to be ineffective in discourse (as I think I am now, sorry). Sometimes it makes me wonder if it&#8217;s blown out of proportion, too, which I don&#8217;t want to.</p></div>

            <p>So much of the tech world seems content to delude itself that it can/should continue as an insular &#8220;man&#8217;s world.&#8221; 
            <br>
            Sadly, this brightest, most creative sector of modern business remains stuck in a slum of the blindest, most hide-bound bigotry and objectification.</p>
            <p>Abuse of a religious or ethnic minority in such a setting would not have been tolerated.</p>
            <p>Perhaps this incident will spark a turn toward equal consideration for the gender that is severely in the minority of most tech professions &#8211; but an enormous portion of the economy that employs tech professionals.</p></div>

            <p>While there aren&#8217;t many women in #rubyonrails, I&#8217;m in there pretty frequently. Very few of the men there have made an issue in a negative way about my gender, and most have been overwhelmingly accepting. People who don&#8217;t know me usually assume there I&#8217;m male (and I rarely correct them, because it doesn&#8217;t matter in that context), but I really don&#8217;t mind that. I am going to RailsConf for the first time this year, which will be the first time I&#8217;ve interacted face-to-face with any Rails devs other than my husband. Should be an interesting experience!</p>
            <p>I hope you don&#8217;t allow negativity to chase you away from something you enjoy.</p></div>

                <div class="content"><p>No one&#8217;s mind has ever been changed by a blog comment.</p>
            <p>With that out of the way, I&#8217;m trying really hard to empathize here.  I like _why.  I like a lot of the people quoted above.  I understand that sex is a sensitive topic for many people.  I understand that the implication of sexual objectification hangs particularly heavily on the stereotypically weaker and objectified gender.  I can empathize with that, but I can&#8217;t condemn Matt.</p>
            <p>First, the presentation is not porn.  It&#8217;s a reference to porn.  The map is not the territory.  The images are barely racier than television ads, even on US TV (OK, maybe one is).  The title of the presentation uses the label &#8220;pr0n&#8221;, which is an obvious mockery of both the porn industry and the subculture in which that spelling is common &#8212; so, the people who do it and the geeks who like it.</p>
            <p>OK, fine.  It was audience-challenging, &#8220;unprofessional&#8221;, and sort of icky..  But how about &#8220;Perform like a beauty queen&#8221;?  Or &#8220;Perform like a heavyweight boxer&#8221;?  &#8220;Perform like a gangsta&#8221;?  Three other professions that are ostensibly voluntary, require a ton of personal sacrifice, pay well (for the elite), often involve pimps<sup>H</sup>H<sup>H</sup>H^Hexploitative managers of naive performers, and hold absolutely zero interest for me, and little interest for most people in the Ruby/Rails community.</p>
            <p>Is the last more upsetting than the others because of the racial implication of the spelling, or the ehtnic implication of its original meaning?</p>
            <p>Is it just the sexual component that gets people all stirred up?  So much that a reference to sex, in an unexpected place, is worth all the drama?  Would sex, ideally, go away?  Be relegated to something that should be considered/discussed/referred to only by two people (male and female, obv) who love each other very much and want to procreate?  Does that sound prudish?</p>
            <p>I&#8217;m sorry that people were offended.  Offense often says more about the offended than the offender, though.  Matt&#8217;s presentation content was good, but the style was unexpected &#8212; and exposed a bug in the sensibility of the observers.  It&#8217;s a big world out there.  It would probably be more productive to fix the bug than to hope to never see unexpected data.  I&#8217;m just sayin.</p>
            <p>PS: I kinda hate CouchDB tho.  They keep using that word &#8220;replication&#8221;.  I do not think it means what you think it means.</p>
            <p> PPS : I remember someone ranting to me about _why&#8217;s ruby tutorial a few years back.  How it was inappropriate, unprofessional, offensive to his sensibilities, and made the whole community look bad.  People are different and take many forms of silly, sometimes.</p></div>

            <p><b>My two cents</b>:</p>
            <p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t need to be {a woman, black, queer, jewish, catholic, muslim,…} to realise something is offensive. In that sense, an applause to <b>Leah Silber</b>&#8217;s &#8220;I find the generalization that this offended women to be offensive. It offended people&#8221;.</p>
            <p>Another applause to her calling people to be open minded. Protesting is perhaps the least effective way of getting people to be treated all as equals: because then <i>you</i> to begin with, <i>you the minority,</i> are standing up as unequal. Quite the slippery slope indeed.</p>
            <p>Any publicity is publicity <a href="http://merbist.com/2009/04/28/on-engendering-strong-reactions/">[citation needed], anyone?)</a> : instead of thinking in terms of right/wrong, try to think of your reactions as dog training. You don&#8217;t lecture a dog on bestiality when it humps a tree, do you?</p>
            <p>Better look at the joke and not find it amusing, and in that sense <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/users/rdy/blog/articles/801-gogaruco-09-couchdb-ruby-perform-like-a-pr0n-star-matt-aimonetti">Ryan Dy&#8217;s annotations</a> were the best manifestation in the round so far.</p></div>

            <p>I think the Ruby and Rails community is about excellence&#8230; at least that&#8217;s what drew me into it.  The perpetual awesomeness I see from folks like Ryan Bates, _why, Gregg Pollack, etc., etc., etc, has inspired me to try to develop myself and my dev. skills so that at some point I can contribute back in to the larger community as a whole.  I know from talking to many Rubyists that they feel exactly the same way.  Chad Fowler&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Follow the Lemmings&#8221; presentation is what really got me off of the proverbial fence.  It was amazingly inspiring.</p>
            <p>I see a lot of rocket fuel being burned on the launchpad instead of being used to propel the Ruby Love Rockets forward.  Can we maybe challenge ourselves to rise above the noise and figure this stuff out?</p>
            <p>How &#8216;bout we seize this as an opportunity to reflect upon what people with different perspectives have said and y&#8217;know&#8230; maybe demonstrate how we&#8217;re not only a &#8220;cut above&#8221; technology-wise but interpersonally as well?</p>
            <p>I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m now hugging everybody as a gesture of friendship at conferences and meetups instead of shaking hands.  If you think that hugging other men is a homosexual act then you&#8217;re absurdly off-base and are really just flattering yourself.  This will be a good reminder to always make sure I&#8217;m wearing deodorant.  :)</p></div>

            <p>Sure, you cannot predict with certainty who you are going to offend, and you certainly cannot please everybody all the time. However, there are general standards of nicety that we can stick to. The attitude of: &#8220;If someone has a problem it&#8217;s their problem and i don&#8217;t care&#8221; is not really very respectful.</p>
            <p>Never mind the gender issue: i feel the same about DHH&#8217;s attitude to swearing. Different people are offended by different words for different reasons, but an easy solution is not to swear &#8211; ever &#8211; and then you avoid the whole problem.</p></div>

            <p>A huge portion of the outrage did not, has not, and will never be about the actual material of the presentation. As destructive as the presentation itself is, the reason that this is still being discussed is because people like you are trying to make it about all porn. It is not about porn, as clearly stated by quotes above, and even more so at the posts that those quotes come from. It is about the dismissal of concerns of a minority by a bunch of locker-room type dudes who don&#8217;t understand that it is not their right to determine whether something is offensive, or sexist.</p>
            <p>So, the explosive controversy had not indeed happened at the time of the presentation. And I am sure there are people who Did walk out. Others perhaps stayed so they could feel fully justified in critiquing it. And as to people voting with their feet, what do you think Mike&#8217;s departure from Rails Activists is? And there will be much more feet voting in the future as people decide to completely avoid the caustic reputation of Rails being a playground for douchebags, so don&#8217;t worry, the people are not as weak or docile as you expect.</p></div>

            <p>I make sex jokes in my talks and all around the conferences. I love a good ribald joke. (This overheard quote from a RailsConf past? Yeah, <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2101">that was me</a>.)</p>
            <p>And yet, I also got &#8220;douche chills&#8221; from the slides.</p>
            <p>Are pr0n star jokes funny? Hell yes. Is it (conceptually) a funny twist on the incredibly annoying &#8220;rock star&#8221; trend? Yep. Was it &#8220;unprofessional&#8221;? Sure, but I also am very unprofessional, and I think that&#8217;s fine. Is Matt Aimonetti a truly nice guy in my experience? Also yes.</p>
            <p>The problem is: eyecandy. Maybe it was &#8220;a map and not a territory,&#8221; but it&#8217;s titillating nonetheless.</p>
            <p>I sure as hell don&#8217;t want to have to worry about the nerd next to me getting turned on when I thought I was attending a database talk.</p>
            <p>More importantly, it was all-boys eyecandy. And so stereotypical at that. It&#8217;s not offensive, but it&#8217;s crass, and not funny crass either. It&#8217;s just a bunch of smooth, mostly-naked, idealized parts.</p>
            <p>If it were near-equal male and female pics, only the prudiest would have been bothered. And we could have brushed it off. If there was some direct humor in the images, that would have helped (think FAILblog type things).</p>
            <p>But none of those factors were taken into account, thus people are hurt, confused, uncomfortable and angry.</p>
            <p>That&#8217;s no big surprise.</p>
            <p>If I put a bunch of naked, pasty, small-dicked nerds in my slides, then somebody would be uncomfortable and pissed. Having a funny title that references something annoying wouldn&#8217;t make that all better.</p>
            <p>Straight up soft core != snark.</p>
            <p>If you are going to try to be edgy and push boundaries and shit, you should at least be sure you&#8217;re <strong>good</strong> at it and know how to handle that kind of content, first. Otherwise, it&#8217;s just destructive.</p>
            <p>It&#8217;s a mistake, and there should be apologies, not encouragement.</p></div>

                <div class="content"><p>This is all very complicated, and I&#8217;m not going to pretend I even understand the specific context of rails conferences. However, I want to speak to the issue of inclusivity in contexts I know.</p>
            <p>Obviously,  FLOSS  isn&#8217;t an open space for women now. You can blame it on about 8.2 billion different things, including gender expectations, the biological snags of motherhood, and the fact that adult women now are still carrying around the baggage of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when they spent their formative years. We all have layered histories that we bring to bear on everything we see and do.</p>
            <p>@Matt Todd refers to creating a gender-neutral space. As a teacher who works very hard to create an inclusive classroom (I&#8217;m in the humanities, not in tech), I can tell you that doing so is a lot more difficult than whitewashing what you say and just generally avoiding offense. There&#8217;s a need for what has been called &#8220;leaning forward&#8221; to make a place more welcoming to people who have to &#8220;lean backward&#8221; everywhere else in their lives. Think of this: everywhere I go, I&#8217;m female. That means when I worked at a computer game company, when I bought a car, when I walk in a city at night, when I shop for clothes, and when I&#8217;m in the supermarket check-out line. As someone pretty conscious of these things, I know that each of those situations highlights the cultural disparities between men and women. (Although my students, bless their hearts, will insist they&#8217;re not affected by ads and culture&#8212;at the same time that they have eating disorders, buy overpriced branded things, and drink themselves silly). This is also of course relevant to people of color, an issue which hasn&#8217;t been addressed here, but perhaps should be.</p>
            <p>So in my classroom&#8212;this one, tiny, almost inconsequential space in my student&#8217;s lives&#8212;I try to make things just a <strong>little</strong> bit nicer for the students who probably are given a hard time at my school. This goes beyond gender and race, so it&#8217;s a judgment call I make. It&#8217;s not a matter of special treatment. And if someone invokes some BS about &#8220;standards&#8221; here, I&#8217;ll write a chapter-length tirade on the history of how &#8220;standards&#8221; have been scrubbed of all of their inherent racism and sexism, etc.</p>
            <p>So my point is this: You have a community with a serious gender imbalance, where women feel isolated and generally unwelcome. Most people in the community agree that this is not desirable. So <i>lean forward</i>, rather than continuing to perpetuate the same sexist BS that happens on TV, in magazines, everywhere else.</p></div>

                <div class="content"><p>_why: That&#8217;s a really good analogy, I think. Leaning forward to catch the whisper of someone whom everyone else talks over. I&#8217;ve always just thought about it conceptually, as meeting someone where they are.</p>
            <p>In practice, of course, it&#8217;s a lot more complicated. So although I suggest here that I&#8217;m particularly reaching out to students who have obvious differences from others, in reality, when I see <em>any</em> student who has differences in their writing, affect, or whatever else, I try to be understanding. There are issues going on with every single person that I can&#8217;t pretend to ever know, but it&#8217;s important for me to acknowledge that I can&#8217;t know them. I might try a little harder to reach out to students who I&#8217;m <strong>sure</strong> are dealing with issues due to gender and race and body type and nerdiness and all other stuff that marks people. Doing this makes me a better teacher to <strong>all</strong> my students, or at least I hope so.</p>
            <p>I realize that simply talking about this makes it hard to distinguish from general, corporate, PC nonsense, which is I think the &#8220;straw man&#8221; set up by the faction who say &#8220;wtf how can you be offended?&#8221;. That BS is easy to dismiss because it&#8217;s awful and insulting to the intelligence of everyone everywhere ever.</p>
            <p>What I&#8217;m talking about it much, much more subtle and much, much more difficult. It&#8217;s a daily practice of making the world a more welcoming place to everyone&#8212;without sacrificing humor or intelligence or dialogue, which is the tricky part. Maybe it&#8217;s best thought of as a zen thing: a practice always there, always in process, rather than the reaching some destination. Political correctness is a kind of endpoint, a right/wrong thing that corporations can hang on to. Making a welcoming community&#8212;something _why is obviously good at&#8212;is a much less cut-and-dry activity.</p></div>

            <p>Also, judging from Matt&#8217;s response on Sarah&#8217;s blog, this seems to have been an honest mistake and error in judgment of how the slides would go over, and a lack of sensitivity to the audience.

            <p>Very good suggestions. Am I right in thinking that inquiring into the mechanisms that triggered an offense would be more &#8216;leaning forward&#8217; than asserting that you have no idea what there is to be offended by? Because that is one of the most seriously damaging things that is going on right now, the dismissal (from a position of male privilege) of the right to be offended. As you say, the Political Correctness angle is being leveraged quite frequently, when that is not the issue (as I see it).</p>
            <p>Building a welcoming community, as you say, is very hard and takes daily work (as does de-conditioning one&#8217;s self from sexism and racism). It is also most definitely worth it.</p>

                <div class="content"><p>All this dialog is interesting to read, since I have heard different takes on &#8216;women in engineering&#8217; over the last three years of higher education.  One of the things I have noticed, in general, about software development is the lack of good, qualified people with critical thinking skills as well as the ability to self-teach.  When I look around at my peers, I see about 80-90% future thoughtless cubical jockeys that picked computer science because they spent so much time on a computer at a younger age (doing things like gaming and browsing the internet), they never developed a passion for other things.  Thus, computer science as a profession was the easy and familiar route, even if that person had no real interest in the underlying process of computer science (programming, electrical computer engineering, etc).  This isn&#8217;t as big of a problem in something like Mechanical Engineering, since you don&#8217;t have many lazy high school students mentally saying &#8220;oh well hmm, what am I going to do when I graduate?  I guess I am pretty good at sitting around and playing with statics and dynamics, so I&#8217;ll take the easy route and get a degree in ME&#8221;.</p>
            <p>On top of this mediocrity we get to add in a lower level of social skills than the norm.  Yeah there are outliers, however through a large amount of direct observation I feel safe in saying the social abilities of computer scientists can be pretty small.</p>
            <p>Now to direct my point: with the large quantity of mediocrity in computer science today, good programmers are hard to come by.  Since there is a significantly smaller population of female programmers, the number of qualified women coders is even smaller.  Add in some poor social skills, and you get a large body of programmers who are bluff, rude and dismissive of their female peers for reasons separate, but in addition to the gender norms we face today.</p></div>

                <div class="content"><p>Thank you for including my tweet (above). Here are some additional thoughts, compiled from my comments about this elsewhere:</p>
            <p>I was not at GoGaRuCo, but I’ve “been there” many times, having been involved with amateur radio, private aviation, classic cars, industrial construction/sales, blues guitar, and of course, software development.</p>
            <p>Those commenting on people&#8217;s supposed hypersensitivity to nudity or bodies are completely missing the point. It&#8217;s not about being prudish. I enjoy a raunchy joke as much as anyone else.</p>
            <p>The issue is not about images. It&#8217;s not about whether it&#8217;s porn or not porn. It’s the underlying message that “they” (women) are not “us” (the men who are the real insiders here at this conference). It&#8217;s about presenting women as an objectified &#8220;other.&#8221; It would have been just as offensive if all the women shown were domineering mothers in aprons, shaking their fingers and threatening with rolling pins.</p>
            <p>Unless you’ve walked into a professional meeting and had conversation stop while everyone looked at you like “what you <strong>you</strong> doing here?” it’s probably hard to imagine the impact.</p></div>

Now, I understand that having a wild night with a great hooker might (MIGHT) be a highly memorable and worthy experience for a man.  But there was no qualification, no statement that this was for men only &#8212; it assumed that only men were reading it.  I didn&#8217;t exist in the mind of the writer.</p>
            <p>(I thought about putting in &#8220;give birth&#8221; as one of the things to do before you die, but to write off half of the population felt too rude for me to do.)</p>
            <p>Since moving to Canada, I&#8217;ve noticed that many many articles are similarly US-centric.  Many articles/postings assume that the reader is a white male in the US.</p>
            <p>To not exist in the writer&#8217;s mind once isn&#8217;t a big deal.  Whatever.  Three times, you start to notice a pattern.  One hundred times, it really starts to piss you off.</p>

                <div class="content"><p>Thanks for your thoughts, @dar. As I said, I wasn&#8217;t there, so I don&#8217;t know what he said over the slides (re: making fun of them). I have seen all the slides, however. Maybe what you pointed out further reinforces the point: The images so completely distracted from the material that the audience didn&#8217;t even get what the presenter was trying to say. People&#8217;s brains just seized up and didn&#8217;t make it past the images.</p>
            <p>When one is in the position of being a communicator, whether writing an instructional manual, teaching a student, designing a UI, or addressing an audience, the responsibility for getting the communication across as intended is your responsibility. That includes being sensitive to the &#8220;listener&#8217;s&#8221; level of understanding of the subject, their cultural background, and a hundred other factors, and crafting the communication in such a way that the listener &#8220;gets it.&#8221;</p>
            <p>There&#8217;s no blaming the listener in professional communications. Sure, we could say &#8220;they weren&#8217;t paying attention,&#8221; &#8220;they just aren&#8217;t smart enough to figure out our app,&#8221; or &#8220;they are just being overly sensitive.&#8221; But that would be just as arrogant (and wrong) as &#8220;it runs fine on my computer, so obviously there&#8217;s nothing wrong with the code, it must be something you did.&#8221;</p>
            <p>If we care about our communication being received, it&#8217;s our job to tailor it to the audience. It may need to be more interesting, written in simpler language, or free of distracting images. We don&#8217;t use open hand icons (such as for &quot;Stop&quot;) in UIs intended for international or inter-cultural distribution, because people from some cultures would find that offensive. By avoiding hand images we are not saying there&#8217;s something wrong with hands. We&#8217;re being sensitive to the listener <strong>so that</strong> they will feel comfortable using our product or Web site.</p>
            <p>The general question around this issue is &#8220;how do we create a culture where women feel comfortable and participate?&#8221; The answer is not &#8220;you&#8217;re just being too sensitive.&#8221;</p></div>

                <div class="content"><p>This whole conversation makes me both tired and sad.</p>
            <p>The only thing that I get from it is the knowledge that individually there are certain programmers with whom I would enjoy conversing. I would probably enjoy conversing with them best at an informal social function that allowed enough light and sturdy napkins for an impromptu diagram of information flow or platform relationship. Though I&#8217;ll probably never meet you _why, you were on the list previously and now there is a strong checkmark beside your name.</p>
            <p>It confirms my gut feeling as well that the gatherings that are the most appropriate for my information intake needs are small meet-ups and local events. I still do intend to travel to San Francisco someday but I experience information overload quite quickly so to experience SF and a technology conference in the same trip would probably be to much for me.</p>
            <p>I look forward to speaking individually with other programmers about programming. I have been contacted by a male colleague who was looking for a woman&#8217;s input as a reality check for himself and it was a very good conversation.</p>
            <p>If any of the men whom I know from conferences and such would like to email me or find me on Twitter or  IRC  to discuss such thoughts you are welcome.</p></div>

            <p>Re: the Muhammed cartoon&#8212;Was I not supposed to get righteously pissed when the NY Post printed the editorial likening my president to not just a chimp, but a chimp shot dead? Don&#8217;t pretend that there is never a valid position of &#8220;offended.&#8221; And in a male-privilege-positive environment such as most  OSS  projects, why is it always on the onus of those offended to justify their offense? Why can&#8217;t you just look into it a bit and start reading some theory that would explain it a bit better? I&#8217;ve read so many things by woman who write of having grown &#8220;thick skin&#8221; as a psychic survival mechanism just to not go insane at the sexism they are subjected to every day.</p>
            <p>Muslims had every right to be offended by that cartoon. A significant line was crossed when they started killing people over it.</p></div>

            <p>The thoughts on expected audience are right on. Everyone knows that porn is still a contentious subject (and blow jobs are porn, it wasn&#8217;t just near nudity). We don&#8217;t yet live in a nudist paradise where people don&#8217;t have hang-ups about sex issues. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you think other people should stop being &#8220;prudes&#8221;, it was obvious that the images would make some people feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. If the conference wasn&#8217;t intended to make everyone feel welcome, then what was it? A club. If this were the 70&#8217;s no one would be surprised, but we&#8217;d call it what it is.</p>
            <p>I don&#8217;t think I can take another guy&#8217;s comment on why we should just shut up and suck it up, though. I suppose I didn&#8217;t get into programming for the charming people.</p></div>

                <div class="content"><p>Matt &#8211; stepping aside from the specific instance here, it&#8217;s not about &#8216;how to we get more women into IT&#8217; but the wider question of &#8216;why has the number of women entering the IT industry, and programming in particular, declined significantly over the since the mid-80s to now&#8217;.</p>
            <p>Given that I&#8217;ve worked with some great female developers, the fact that I don&#8217;t know any under 30 is suggesting that we, as an industry, are missing out on talent.</p>
            <p>The why of how this has occurred, on the other hand, is fairly complex, and I&#8217;m not actually sure that it&#8217;s something that the industry can itself address. Most girls are not getting far enough along the IT education route to become driven out by workplace sexism.</p>
            <p>Equally there are other careers / workplaces with a reputation for sexism (finance, law, advertising) which do not suffer the same recruitment problems. Surveys suggest that the &#8216;geek factor&#8217; is the biggest &#8216;turn off&#8217; for both female and male students towards the sciences in general, and engineering and IT in particular.</p>
            <p>We can&#8217;t really do a whole lot to change that perception, except not encourage it. One presentation isn&#8217;t going to make a whole lot of difference in the wider world, but I think what people see here is that it&#8217;s symptomatic of a deeper cultural problem.</p>
            <p>(There is a gap between amateur and unprofessional).</p>
            <p>The other thing we can do are things like _why?&#8217;s projects, where we try and reach out to kids and show them that programming is relatively simple and can be fun, before they get old enough to start distinguishing their swots, nerds, geeks, jocks and emos.</p></div>

            <p>Why (no pun intended) did it start?

                <div class="content"><p>Could we please move on to the solutions part?</p>
            <p>As of about noon Saturday there have been a grand total of 3 people who have changed their minds about the original presentation, or whether the response to the response (to the response, &#8230;) was sexist or not.</p>
            <p>Since about noon-oh-five Saturday, all that has been achieved on either side is further withdrawal into a defensive stress condition which prevents the objective processing of information.</p>
            <p>A vast majority of the people who did not see any issue with the above will respond positively to the idea of trying to ensure there is no sexism in the community.</p>
            <p>We have our hands full with just that, anyway: there is no consensus of what, if anything, should be done, and whether there can really be a strategy for involving more <em>women</em> as opposed to <em>people</em> who happen to be women? Should men be actively involved, or should women act as the catalysts? How do these efforts relate to trying to introduce more, say, black people or gay people to the community?</p>
            <p>(Personally, by the by, treating any group as, well, a group strikes a chord of offence in me, which probably causes me to focus too much on individuals and reject perfectly viable &#8220;group solutions&#8221; without due consideration. I feel a bit stupid saying that, and certainly do not mean it as a boast, but I think many if not most others have a similar instinctive/conditioned apprehension. I hope the feeling I describe comes across understandably.)</p>
            <p>So what can I, as an individual, do <em>proactively</em>? (I would like to think that reactively I treat everyone with equal distaste.)</p></div>

            <p>I mean, humor is great and all, but that presentation wasn&#8217;t funny at all.. Which in my opinion crushed every chance of it going over well. Had it been done in a more &#8220;tasteful&#8221; way (to whatever extent that word applies to this situation..) and balanced maybe it wouldn&#8217;t have caused as much of an outrage.</p>
            <p>But of course, it&#8217;s not just about it being poorly done. Many feel that it shouldn&#8217;t have been done at all, and I think they&#8217;re right. There were so many ways to do that presentation and not offend people, while still being unfunny, that it just boggles the mind why he picked this one.</p>
            <p>And I really don&#8217;t feel that all of what&#8217;s going on at the moment is directly related to that presentation.

            <p>I wasn&#8217;t at the talk, but looking at the slides I thought they were quite dumb. There was a lot that could have been done with the slides to make them much better and engaging.</p>
            <p>Given that, however, there was no nudity in the slides. Where they in bad taste? Sure. Was it unprofessional? Sure. Was it pornographic? No. Go to a beach and you&#8217;d see more than that.</p>
            <p>To all the people who are offended, what would your reaction be if this had been full of the flying spaghetti monster and had poked fun at religion? Would the theists have been so offended (since you would be the only people qualified to speak on the matter, having been marginalized during the talk)? If you were offended, does it matter? Do you have the unassailable right to go to the talk and  NOT  be offended? Where does it say that?</p>
            <p>Basically my point is that the talk was stupid, and immature, but so what? If you don&#8217;t like it you don&#8217;t throw out things like you have to &#8220;leave the community&#8221;, that&#8217;s just blatantly stupid and over dramatic. Just don&#8217;t associate with people who you find disrespectful/don&#8217;t share your beliefs. Eventually the level of class and respect shown in the

            <p>Also where did I say that degrading women was acceptable? All I said was ask what right you have to not be offended, and to stifle the presenters (attempt at) creativity?</p>
            <p>So you were offended. Ok that&#8217;s great. Does that somehow make your point of view more valid than the presenters?</p>
            <p>Just to be clear. I might not agree with what you have to say, sir, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. Make a rule banning that type of behavior, or live with it.</p></div>

            <p>Adulteration of a pure presentation by something completely innocent (food coloring) is a broken analogy here.  But then, you probably know that&#8230;</p>
            <p>As a male, I&#8217;ve never had a moment&#8217;s patience for the quiet biases of those waspy good old boy&#8217;s club types.  To use the 2nd-best phrase I&#8217;ve learned here, I &#8216;lean forward&#8217; to help good people that generally catch hell from these biased bohunks or oblivious arrested-development types.  And everyone that rails (pun unintentional) against the reaction of this dumbass and inappropriate presentation &#8216;doth protest too much.&#8217;  Yeah, I <strong>know</strong> you don&#8217;t get it.  And if you don&#8217;t get  THIS , how many of your other screwups am I going to spend time cleaning up after&#8230; better to surround myself with people that are eager to learn and adapt,  IMHO .</p>
            <p>My takeaway from this is that I need to be quicker to challenge this publicly, quicker to walk out.  Women might find this strange: a willingness to make a fuss is damn tough for me &#8212; the &#8216;play nice with others&#8217; trait of mine that would instinctively know this presentation was out of line makes walking out near-unthinkable for waspy male me.</p></div>

            <p>I guess I just don&#8217;t understand the problem fully. If the people &#8220;on high&#8221; don&#8217;t agree with your moral system, then why are they in control? If they&#8217;re so far off base (which this incident seems to suggest with the amount of backlash which has occurred), why are they still given a voice? This just makes no sense to me.</p>
            <p>( FYI  I am a much more passive ruby user, one who uses it for scripting jobs when I need to get something done and not in any real deployment scenario. As such I am not really into the whole culture which, quite frankly, I find to be childish, so I don&#8217;t really have my fingers on the pulse of the community.)</p>
            <p>The real question I have for you is, therefore, why don&#8217;t you (the collective you) set the moral standard you would like to see by setting up conferences which  ARE  professional in nature? You could then weed out this kind of douche-baggery by the participants (via censorship), and instead be more like an  IEEE / ACM  conference which are much more formal affairs? This seems to be what people  ASSUMED  were going to happen, where really what you got was something more akin to a talk between friends.</p></div>

            <p>Also I don&#8217;t think that being upset or annoyed that said talk happened is unreasonable. As I said, however, I do think it is unreasonable that people think that because they were offended that somehow means that the talk shouldn&#8217;t have happened.</p>
            <p>In the end I think this will be the spark of change, and make people aware that not all people who go to these conferences are &#8220;pasty, small-dicked nerds&#8221;, and instead they are people who have a completely different sense of humor/right and wrong. With this in mind maybe we can drop the latent sexism from both sides, and realize that we are dealing with adults who, horror of horrors, are immature and have access to unlimited adult content (be it porn or gratuitous violence, etc). Without any kind of checks and balances it should be as shocking to you as it is to me that informal talks degenerate into 5th grade humor.</p>

                <div class="content"><p>I find this male bashing going on very hypocritical. The answer to this is simple. If you care about the nature of the content at a conference, only go to ones that have some sort of statement of intent that you agree to. If the conference breaks that intent, make a complaint to the appropriate people in charge, wait for a response and make a decision. If they don&#8217;t have such a statement, ask for one. What happens if you find yourself with no conference that appeal to you? Start your own. Freedom of Association is a powerful force and one that doesn&#8217;t impinge on others&#8217; rights to be crass and misogynistic(consciously or unconsciously) in the public square.

            <p>This has certainly transcended the original presentation in terms of importance for the Ruby community, and if nothing else seems to have brought out some long standing issues of alienation and feelings of uncomfortableness based on gender.</p>
            <p>I feel a great deal of empathy for people who are feeling alienated after reading the insightful comments on this post, and hope that I have not, and do not contribute to such feelings.  I must admit that I didn&#8217;t fully grasp the extent of the feelings of some people that have commented here, and it&#8217;s been a great education for me to have read them.  Thankyou.</p>
            <p>I am also acutely aware now that this is a long standing issue.  Matt may have made a mistake in presenting the way he did, and unintentionally offending ppl.  The offense caused was unintentional though and I know that the response has caused a lot of anguish.</p>
            <p>I hope that we can all see past the trigger for the discussion and get into the underlying problem.  What I&#8217;m trying to say, is that Matt, although his presentation did trigger the response, and therefore the discussion, is not the cause of the problem, and I hope that we collectively do not hold him singularly responsible for these feelings in the workplace.</p>
            <p>I am very grateful to the people who have made such insightful comments, and have a much better understanding of the feelings that occur in these situations now.  Thankyou.</p></div>
