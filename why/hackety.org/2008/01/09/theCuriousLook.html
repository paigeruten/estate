  <div class="author">by why</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Well, that&#8217;s pretty wild.  Simultaneous to yesterday&#8217;s Shoes release, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/ruby/2008/01/14/shoes-meets-merb-interfacing-a-gtk2-front-end-and-a-rails-web-service.html">big article</a> exploring a little Shoes app on O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s site by Gregory Brown and Brad Ediger.  And it goes through Shoes and Merb together.  Let us be friends, Merb.  Anyway, you&#8217;ve probably already seen it.</p>
<p>I totally have no complaints with the article, writing those long articles has got to take forever.  I just wanted to post another screenshot of Shoes here, because I think those could be better.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/shoes-jot.png" class="c" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, this example is actually really close to the pastebin example given in the article.  This one&#8217;s the start of a clone of  <del>Chris Wanstrath&#8217;s</del>  PJ Hyett&#8217;s <a href="http://vjot.com/">vJot</a> site, which is sort of a pastebin, too.  You paste a title and a full entry and it saves as it goes.</p>
<p>This example doesn&#8217;t save to disk, so <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/svn/shoes/tags/0.r396-curious/samples/jot.rb">the code</a> focuses on just adding new elements and handling link clicks.  And this example here was a big part of shaping the new Curious look and shaping some new features in Shoes.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Scroll panes.</strong>  The link list in the middle is a fixed-height stack.  It&#8217;s 200 pixels high.  And when its contents grow longer than that, a vertical scroll bar shows.  (Shoes doesn&#8217;t do horizontal scrollbars.)</li>
	<li><strong>Change events.</strong>  This example saves as you type.  This is done by tacking a block on to the edit_line or edit_box.  And the block is executed with each keystroke.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic link text.</strong>  The link text is altered as you type.</li>
	<li><strong>Curved borders and backgrounds.</strong>  This is rather minor, but you can supply a :radius option to any border or background.  Perhaps we will see a plethora of decorative corners for Shoes!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps Shoes is already a bit antiquated since most programming has moved to the web already.  Who knows the future of desktop apps.  I guess I figure that, when it comes to learning and to hobby, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether it&#8217;s running far or near.  The code with the least resistance and the most action wins.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying Shoes is that code.  But maybe Shoes will inspire something new, just as NodeBox and Processing and <span class="caps">REBOL</span>/View have inspired Shoes.</p>

    <div class="content"><blockquote><p>&quot;Perhaps Shoes is already a bit antiquated since most programming has moved to the web already&#8230;&#8217;</p></blockquote><p>I wouldn&#8217;t say antiquated.  I like shoes because it&#8217;s helping me to do something I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise.</p><p>Hackety Hack inspired me to learn Rails and now shoes is teaching me to better understand how ruby actually works.</p><p>I think what I am saying is that the sum of Shoes&#8217; good points are greater than its parts. Let&#8217;s not define its usefulness too narrowly&#8211;which brings me to another point: count me as one more vote for a shoes gem.  That is my NOVICE opinion!</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>_why, to be fair&#8230; Brad Ediger wrote most of the shoes stuff for this article, so you may want to cred him.  (I focused on the merb stuff).</p><p>This screenshot is definitely prettier, with us about 2 times over our article length limit&#8230; we sadly didn&#8217;t have room for pretty. :)</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Well, Greg did thoroughly rebuke me for my original version that monkeypatched both Shoes and Merb. Apparently such skin-tight coupling of vastly disparate components is a bad thing these days?</p><p>And I know my screenshots don&#8217;t have a tenth of the sex appeal that yours do, but hey, people still need to buy <a href="../../../2007/10/29/nobodyKnowsShoes.html">the book</a>, right?</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Hm, there&#8217;s a fencepost error with the border-versus-background thing in the above example: there&#8217;s a one-pixel leakage of background past the border to the right and to the bottom.  I&#8217;m guessing you need to internally make backgrounds smaller by a pixel or else borders larger by that same amount.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Actually, I think the curved borders/backgrounds are rather big news since they remove the need for a log of ugly image hacks.  I think that&#8217;s worth a lot more than it might look on face value.</p></div>
