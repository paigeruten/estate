<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_05KxIVka50">Plainfield</a>: This could lead to&#8230; tiny hatreds&#8230; building up little by little&#8230; throughout the duration&#8230; of the development and testing processes.  It is to this end that I would to like to propose a system of introspection and collaboration of information that&#8230; I&#8217;m sure you will find to our mutual benefit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loads upon loads of sheer poppycock.  While I can admire Plainfield&#8217;s candor and the remarkable rapport which he holds with the camera lens, his conflated tone so very does flake my ears away, even as the molting of an aged pelican into the Chesapeake Bay.  While I myself have no small affinity for Information and these selfsame platitudes, how quickly I tire of the brash monologues which now clog our youtubes.  My migraines are pounding away now with tribal lust and I can do naught but for a nightcap and the tender comforts of a kind buttermilk.</p>
<p>Also, might I add something about goose-stepping morons who should be reading books instead of burning them!</p>

    <div class="content"><p>I hope it didn&#8217;t take him more than one take to film that&#8230;</p><p>Yes, AI generated sigils, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s missing! We have all these little hatreds, because we haven&#8217;t let the cyclons do the project management. Or tell us who is part of a project. Presumably, since he removes the extra step of listing the members of the project, the cyclons will also decide who should be a member of the project. Just read their filesystem, and see if they are a good match.</p><p>I guess I better be carefull about my naming conventions, or I&#8217;ll end up getting assigned to QA automatic cat litterbox scooping devices.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>That was a truly awful parody. I didn&#8217;t even realize that ridiculous hat and revolting accent were attempting to do said parody until he almost directly, though poorly, quoted <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_vantage/therewillbeblood/domestictrailer1/">There Will Be Blood</a>.</p><p>I link to the trailer because it is now crucial that all able persons see this work of sheer brilliance for two main reasons. First, the aforementioned brilliance. Second, the newfound appreciation one will have after having seen the film for exactly how awful the video posted here is.</p></div>
