<p>It just baffles me.  There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.philipkdick.com/works_covers.html">landslide</a> of interesting Philip K. Dick covers out there.  And yet, were you to pick up <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, you&#8217;d likely wind up with the schmaltzy construction paper torso of astonishment at right.  Are those supposed to be surprise lines or something?  No, that naked, armless guy is embarassed, poor thing!  &#8220;Hey, I thought I was posing for a can of Paul Mitchell primping wax!  What&#8217;s with all this dystopia??&#8221;</p>
<p>Couldn&#8217;t we have just stick with <a href="http://www.philipkdick.com/covers/tmithc24.jpg">white tiger</a> on a ledge?  Or <a href="http://www.philipkdick.com/covers/tmithc-czech.jpg">czech</a> this one!</p>
<p>See, this is exactly the benefit of used books.  Aside from the glorious marginalia and ad-hoc footnoting, you get to find a nice, fun cover that isn&#8217;t around no more.  And where does one go to scoop up used books?  You go to <a href="http://abebooks.com/">AbeBooks</a>, probably.</p>
<hr />

<p>Here is what AbeBooks looks like:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/abebooks1.png" class="cb" alt="" /></p>
<p>Some entries have covers, but a lot don&#8217;t.  Usually they only show the covers of the newest editions.</p>
<p>However, we can grab some editions from the cover library at LibraryThing:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/abebooks2.png" class="cb" alt="" /></p>
<p>This hack will only add covers to AbeBooks.  If Abe already shows a picture (and some booksellers do show a photo of the actual book from their inventory,) then those images will be left alone.</p>
<p>Of course, some entries are still blank.  If there is no <span class="caps">ISBN</span>.  Or if LibraryThing lacks the cover &#8212; which is common, but less common than Amazon.</p>
<hr />

<p>Here&#8217;s a shot of an updated book page, with the real cover.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/abebooks3.png" class="cb" alt="" /></p>
<p>See?  A fine, illustrated cover from days of yore.  Devoid of panicky torsos and their ilk.</p>
<p>The Greasemonkey script is entitled <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/31662">AbeBooks Covers</a> at Userscripts.org.  Find yourself a Clooney-free Solaris.</p>

    <h3>Note from the LibraryThing guy...</h3>
    <div class="time">said on <strong>August

    <div class="content"><p>Two points on a cool idea.</p>
<p>1. You&#8217;re going to need to change the developer key. Developer keys are assigned personally, not to be given out in free scripts to people who have not agreed with the developer key agreement.<br>
2. This is a cool script, but it has potential to confuse and prompt some bad buying. Covers are not, unfortunately, truly  ISBN -specific. At least, they don&#8217;t  HAVE  to beâ€”the rule is that the  ISBN  only need change when the <strong>interior</strong> of the book changes, and even that is flauted. I think it would be a shame if someone bought a Cluny-less cover and, when it arrived, it was Cluny-full.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>EmC:  Lem&#8217;s work divides loosely into three categories:</p>
<ol>
	<li>sublimely ridiculous techo-yarns</li>
	<li>demonstrations that the universe is unintelligible</li>
	<li>pseudo-nonfiction or Borgesian &#8220;fictions&#8221;, e.g. prefaces to or reviews of non-existent books.</li>
</ol>
<p>For techno-yarns, try <em>The Star Diaries</em> or <em>The Cyberiad</em>.</p>
<p><em>Solaris</em> is the most famous example of the latter category, but the only English translation is a second-gen translation from French.  I liked <em>The Invincible</em> and <em>Fiasco</em>.</p>
<p>Examples of the pseudo-nonfiction are <em>Imaginary Magnitude</em> and <em>Microworlds</em>.</p>
<p>The collection <em>Mortal Engines</em> is a good starting point (and it contains the story from which I nabbed my moniker).</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>@EmC: automatthew summed it up nicely.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d personally recommend <i>Invincible</i> for straight-ahead sci-fi awesomeness, and <i>The Cyberiad</i> for more imaginative and humorous fare (see also Calvino&#8217;s <i>t zero</i> and <i>Cosmicomics</i>.)</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>I agree with dave, I like the cover of this copy:</p>
<p><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3173/2761145870_cf3402a679.jpg?v=1218663575" alt=""></p>
<p>P.S.: Yes that is my self bound copy of the Poignant Guide, I saw it on my bookshelf when I went hunting for Dick, so to speak.</p>
<p>P.P.S.: The Clooney Solaris wasn&#8217;t that bad, you just have to mentally separate it from Lem&#8217;s and Tarkovsky&#8217;s. Well I liked the soundtrack anyway.</p></div>
