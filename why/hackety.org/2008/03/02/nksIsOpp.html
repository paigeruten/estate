  <div class="author">by why</div>
  <div class="content"><p>As of today, <em>Nobody Knows Shoes</em> doesn&#8217;t belong to me any more.  I have disowned it.  Disowned it in both <a href="../../../press/"><span class="caps">PDF</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span></a>.  I have given it to the publick.  It was a bad idea.  I realize that now.  Clearly!  So much egg on my face.  And sooooo many pancakes on my knee.</p>
<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rocketraccoon/2209545886/"><img src="../../../images/nks-rr.jpg" class="rb" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Many of you tried to tell me it was a bad idea.  In fact, you told me that all of my ideas were bad.  All present and future ideas.  So I could have concluded that this was, as well, <span class="caps">YES</span>, a bad idea.</p>
<p>But it simply did not occur to me, at the time, that I was probably crazy and probably even insane.  I could not see this clearly, from inside my head.  However, now that I have had a chance to read a bit more about myself on the Internet, I now see realize I am very berserk nuts and probably doing drugs.  I mean, duh, guys, everything that I say is totally unintelligible!  You can hardly make out an actual English word when I write.  It&#8217;s bad.  I am spamming the good hackers of our planet.</p>
<p>My first step to recovery is to completely denounce <em>Nobody Knows Shoes</em>.  I am distancing myself from it.  It&#8217;s now completely on its own.  I hate it.  It reminds me of a very dark time in my life.  Don&#8217;t make me go there.  It gives me the chilly willies to even think about.</p>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>Felix:</strong> It&#8217;s true!  I&#8217;m so glad to start over.  I will now have plenty of time to work on an Access database and some mail merges for a local realtor.</p><p><strong>Matt Brubeck:</strong> No updates to anything.  If I ever look at shoes again, I will put those into something new.</p><p>The rest of you are probably all spambots because no one knows shoes, no one cares about it, they have other things to do.  There are so many personalized checkbooks to get and lots of new dvds to rent at macdonalds.  It is dizzying and I&#8217;m just starting to get the picture!</p></div>

You must be doing something right.</p><p>I think it&#8217;s pretty funny that someone took you up on your offer and put it up on Ebay.

    <div class="content"><p><strong>H4z3:</strong> Your remarks have struck a chord, a very resonant chord.  You are absolutely right!  I have been too vain, using selfy words, blowdrying my hair and batting my eyelashes at myself.  I must stop this senseless wearing of the mirrored gloves, a practice that served only to remind me of how I looked down at dog&#8217;s level, where the hands swing.</p><p>I denounce everything I have said in this post and am starting anew.  I have reformatted all of my hard drives with a repeating ASCII pattern of DIE YOU VAPID ME and do not ask me about it.  These were the follies of youth. Of a palsied and youthful, sick mind.  I cannot emphasize the &#8220;sick&#8221; enough.  Would that I could use every possible HTML tag to emphasize it to you.</p><p>Now let&#8217;s no longer dig up the past, but be only the best of friends.  Come, let us dine on roasted sweet duck and waste the day away with an elaborate tournament of flag football!!</p><p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Would Amanda Baggs happen to be related to a video arcade game called Bagman?  Because a bagman is a robber who steals money from the savings and loan.</p><p><strong>kevinc:</strong> The Shoes list has talked about transporting copies through the public library system.  Perhaps you could submit your changes under the dewey decimal of 819.12 and we&#8217;ll keep an eye.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><blockquote><p>Come, let us dine on roasted sweet duck and waste the day away with an elaborate tournament of flag football!!</p></blockquote><p>Is it a single-elimination or double-elimination tournament? Perhaps for good measure we should preface the tournament with round-robin play and some form of draft system&#8230;just so long as I&#8217;m not picked last! (Oh, who am I kidding&#8230;I&#8217;m always picked last&#8230;)</p><p>P.S. If these shoes could walk on water I&#8217;d be no more impressed&#8230;well, maybe a little more</p></div>
