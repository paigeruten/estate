  <div class="content"><p>François Lamotte took some time to e-mail in about his friend 4P8.  He thought we&#8217;d like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.4p8.com/lew/manifesto.html">4P8</a>: In the same time, the personal computing paradigm matured. The original rogue program that assumed a total control over what was perceived as a hobbyist toy have now to behave nicely. It has to comply with access rights, to accept and process requests from the graphical environment, to follow a rigorous syntactic and conceptual model and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, here we&#8217;ve got another tricky, little graphical gear to spin!  <a href="http://www.4p8.com/lew/"><span class="caps">LEW</span></a> is an art tool which embeds the Lua language and it&#8217;s inspired by (you guessed it) NodeBox and Processing.  And <span class="caps">BASIC</span>.  The gallery is incredibly impressive.  And equally impressive is the brevity and usefulness of its <a href="http://www.4p8.com/lew/reference.html">manual</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/lew-flight.png" class="rb" alt="" /></p>
<p>You know, things continue to bode well for a real return to the days of bloat-free, starter programming environments.  Small and for the layfolk.  In fact, <span class="caps">LEW</span> makes me feel like Shoes is bloated:  <span class="caps">LEW</span> is a single binary, around 400k.  (Windows only, for now.)</p>
<p>The image at right is a clone of a <a href="http://flight404.com/">flight404</a> demo called &#8220;Solar&#8221;.  Roughly 250 lines of Lua code.</p>
<hr />

<p>Continuing the quote from earlier:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this an advocacy to return to <span class="caps">BASIC</span> ? No: the old <span class="caps">BASIC</span> is clearly too primitive to handle problems we&#8217;re now used to deal with, and new <span class="caps">BASIC</span> implementations have just grow in complexity the same way other languages did.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The conclusion is a need to an equivalent of what <span class="caps">BASIC</span> was in old personal computer industry: a simple, exploratory language.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>_Why a great thank you for LEW.</p><p>@James LEW is just starting, 2 month old and it&#8217;s build to run on any environnement. 4P8 has just started on the windows environment. On the first stable release, we&#8217;ll seek anyone interested to play with it on other plateform.</p><p>Grummmphy has already played with LEW in Linux with wine.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Impressive work ! And as I am under windows, I think I am about to learn a bit of Lua :-)<br>
It may be a bit early, but I am (also) at this time developping a Ruby library to generate vector graphics ala Nodebox.<br>
If this interests someone, it can be checked at http://xrvg.rubyforge.org/. You can also check some &#8220;in progress&#8221; gallery at http://fractalyze.blogspot.com/ ,to get some idea about what can be done with it.</p></div>
