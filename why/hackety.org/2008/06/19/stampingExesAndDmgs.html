  <div class="author">by why</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Here&#8217;s a brief Ruby script&#0151;one that demos Shoes&#8217; events and animation&#0151;and it&#8217;s been injected into an <span class="caps">EXE</span> and a <span class="caps">DMG</span>:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; width: 340px; margin: 0 auto"><div style="width: 160px; float:left"><a href="../../../bin/accordion.exe"><img src="../../../images/accordion-exe.png" /></a><br /><a href="../../../bin/accordion.exe">accordion.exe</a><br /><span style="color:#552">84.0 KB</span></div><div style="width: 160px; float:left"><a href="../../../bin/accordion.dmg"><img src="../../../images/accordion-dmg.png" /></a><br /><a href="../../../bin/accordion.dmg">accordion.dmg</a><br /><span style="color:#552">43.4 KB</span></div><p></div><br clear="all" /></p>
<p>These are web installers. Using native calls on each platform, they&#8217;ll install Shoes if no Shoes is found on the system.  (If you already have Shoes installed, though, it won&#8217;t <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/RecentBuilds">update</a> for you.)  Not a big deal, not worth mentioning really.  Installers.</p>
<p>But, hold up.  What if I told you that Shoes can build EXEs and DMGs on any of its platforms?  Without needing a compiler.  You can build EXEs and DMGs from Windows.  And from Linux.  And from OS X.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/shoes-packager.png" class="c" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is the built-in packager, which can be brought up with <code>shoes -p</code> (or <code>shoes --package</code> on Windows and Linux.  On OS X, it&#8217;s in the Shoes main menu.  (Or ⌘-x.)</p>
<p>Even as Ron Popeil is to the unflavored turkey, so is Shoes to these most willing binaries.</p>
<hr />

<p>The magic is a little Ruby extension I use for manipulating EXEs and DMGs.  It&#8217;s based on two programs: <a href="http://www.mikekohn.net/file_formats/anal_pe.php">anal_pe</a> and <a href="http://github.com/planetbeing/xpwn">xpwn</a>.</p>
<p>If you poke around with a hex editor inside Windows&#8217; PE binary format, you&#8217;ll find an .rsrc section at the end of the file which contains the icons and dialog boxes.  I insert the Ruby script into this mess.</p>

<pre><code class="rb">binj = Binject::EXE.new("blank.exe")
binj.inject("SHOES_FILENAME", "simple-accordion.rb")
File.open("simple-accordion.rb") do |f|
  binj.inject("SHOES_PAYLOAD", f)
end
binj.save("accordion.exe")
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>blank.exe</strong> is the empty web installer.  It&#8217;s an executable that scans its own resources and then bases its moves on what it finds.  If it finds a Ruby script (or Shy file) in the <code>SHOES_PAYLOAD</code> resource, it&#8217;ll run it.  And if it finds an installer in the <code>SHOES_SETUP</code> resource, it&#8217;ll run the installer rather than going out to the web.</p>
<p>So, yeah, <strong>blank.exe</strong> comes with Shoes and we inject when you go to package.  Yeah?</p>
<hr />

<p>Fabricating DMGs is a different kind of binary hacking.  In this case, we&#8217;ve got to build an HFS+ partition and then convert that to a <span class="caps">DMG</span>.</p>
<p>One would start by making a small, raw HFS+ file and gzipping it.</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ dd if=/dev/zero of=blank.hfs bs=512K count=1
$ mkfs.hfsplus -v Shoes blank.hfs
$ gzip blank.hfs
$ mv blank.hfs.gz blank.hfz
</code></pre>
<p>This blank disk gets included with Shoes as well.  And at runtime, we use our extension to build the innards of the <span class="caps">DMG</span>.</p>

<pre><code class="rb">binj = Binject::DMG.new("blank.hfz", "Accordion")
binj.inject_dir("Accordion.app", "/tmp/accordion.app")
binj.chmod_file(0755, "Accordion.app/Contents/MacOS/accordion-launch")
binj.save("accordion.dmg")
</code></pre>
<p>This amazing code is only possible due to tons of incredible work by the XPwn dev team.  First of all, their <span class="caps">DMG</span> and HFS+ code is totally portable and only depends on zlib.  But also, the <span class="caps">API</span> is just too easy.  Their project is going to catch on big, not only in jail breaking the iPhone from any platform, but in building DMGs from the commandline on OS X itself!</p>
<p>Since both anal_pe and XPwn are <span class="caps">GPL</span>, I&#8217;m afraid this extension must be <span class="caps">GPL</span> as well.  The rest of Shoes is <span class="caps">MIT</span>.  Which is okay I guess since the packager isn&#8217;t really needed to run Shoes apps.</p>
<hr />

<p>This is all a bleeding fresh part of <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/RecentBuilds">today&#8217;s</a> builds.</p>
<p>As for Linux.  I&#8217;m not decided as to what to do about generating Linux binaries.  Either using <a href="http://megastep.org/makeself/">makeself</a> or plain shell scripting will do.  But do I download binaries or automate package manager steps?  The unsurety.</p>

<p>Re: linux, on debian/ubu I&#8217;d&#8230; well&#8230; I can&#8217;t think of the last thing I installed that was&#8217;t a rubygem or via apt-get or via source. I only live in that world on ui-less production boxes, so no fancy Shoes apps in that world anyway. I could have not written this paragraph.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>&gt; But do I download binaries or automate package manager steps?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d suggest creating a .deb file and uploading it to a Launchpad  PPA  maybe? Launchpad is to debs as github is to gems in a way. If the client supports apturl, things are easy peasy. (Ignoring fedora/gentoo users.)</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Seems like downloading binaries for Linux is the way to go.  If you&#8217;re reasonably conservative about the shlibs you require a fairly vanilla Linux binary will run in virtually every distribution.  The package approach would be nice but you&#8217;d need to support at least .deb and .rpm which could be more pain than it&#8217;s worth.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>Feoh:</strong> I think I&#8217;ll follow your suggestion, only relying on openssl and zlib to be present on the system.  I guess I could probably have the shell script sniff out exactly what it needs.  That could prevent the download of gtk, glib, cairo, pango and vlc.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>It isn&#8217;t working on Mac OS Leopard intel either, frozen progress bar doodad. It does make the .dmg and .exe though, even though there is no progress, however when I mount the  DMG  and run the .app, shoes opens and asks me which ruby file to run. O_o</p>
<p>Also what about dependancies like pictures and junk? gotta figure those in too! Maybe shoes should be like camping, have appname.rb and a directory named appname, and put all your junk in there. Be easy to do on Mac, but on windows maybe you could shove the directory data in to a zip and write the zipped data in to the exe? Surely windows provides api&#8217;s for unzipping stuff, which could be shoved out to a temporary directory. :)</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>I got it figured out on an Intel-Leopard to build the apps. works like charm (even with pics and stuff if you build a shy).<br>
Only there are some flaws I discovered:<br>
- It won&#8217;t build any &#8216;Linux&#8217; package for me<br>
- It freezes after having created the exe and dmg and dies eventually (might be connected to the above)<br>
- It does not include shoes in the exe/dmg if asked to do so</p>
<p>Oh and one minor thing is that I need to dig around to find a way of building the shy since shoes -s won&#8217;t work and you don&#8217;t have the option to build it in the menu.<br>
shoes-launch -s is the way on Leopard.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Punting on the version dependecies is kinda sucky.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a really old version installed. The exe above launches fine but the app itself errors out on &#8220;uninitialized constant&#8221; or some such. If you&#8217;re going to detect that I have Shoes installed and not upgrade me, you could at least tell me that the version I have isn&#8217;t compatible with the app I&#8217;m trying to run. And then give me the option to upgrade.</p></div>
