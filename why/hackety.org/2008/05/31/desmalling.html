  <div class="author">by why</div>
  <div class="content"><p>Shoes must cease growing to keep claiming its tinyness.  Except for the manual.  Let the manual bloat.  I want a fantastic manual.  The manual is pretty much the best Shoes app out there!</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/shoes-manual-1.png" class="c" alt="" /></p>
<p>This is the built-in manual.  It&#8217;s not terribly gorgeous yet.</p>
<p>Use: <code>shoes -m</code>.  Or Alt-Question-Mark on any Shoes app.  And there it is.  (In <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/RecentBuilds">recent builds</a>.)</p>
<hr />

<p>If you&#8217;ve not heard of <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/">Shoes</a>, it&#8217;s a kit for writing graphical apps in Ruby.  I hope that it strikes balance between easiness and usefulness.  Some folks write <a href="http://the-shoebox.org/">games</a> for Shoes.  I&#8217;m writing a <a href="http://hacketyhack.net/">teaching tool</a> in Shoes.  The kit is pretty flexible, but concentrates on doing a very small number of things well.</p>
<p>Like, for instance, there are <a href="../../../press/nks-9.html">ten essential</a> commands in Shoes that are used in absolutely everything.</p>
<p>Beyond those ten things, though, are a hundred more things.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/shoes-manual-2.png" class="c" alt="" /></p>
<p>Shoes has about a hundred methods total for creating new elements, applying effects, manipulating the app, events, and all of that.  Most of these things just give beginners a place to go once they get past the basics.</p>
<p>Add another hundred methods on top of that among all the various objects you can create.</p>
<hr />

<p>Rather than memorizing those methods, I recommend to beginners that they commit <strong>only the ten essentials</strong> to memory.  And, for everything else, use the manual&#8217;s built-in search.</p>
<p>Looking to draw a rectangle?  <strong>Use the search.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../../../images/shoes-manual-3.png" class="c" alt="" /></p>
<p>No submit button, it searches as you type.</p>
<p>Search results display as a list of links throughout the manual.  Method links take you straight to that method.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/shoes-manual-4.png" class="c" alt="" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m only halfway completed with documenting Shoes.  But, it will be done for the next release.</p>
<p>For me, having a good manual is more important than even Shoes&#8217; stability, perhaps.  As one of the only app kits out there focused on beginners, it&#8217;s crucial that Shoes become an example of how to innovate the way people learn.  I think having a really capable search in the built-in manual is a huge part of that.</p>
<p>Another part is having a lot of examples that can be executed right there in the manual text (like you see with docs for jQuery or Scriptaculous.)  Processing&#8217;s docs definitely benefit from having working applets next to their examples.</p>
<p>To have the freedom to alter the code in the docs to get some understanding might really have an impact.</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Thanks for taking the time, this is just what i was looking for, quick searching  NKS  doesn&#8217;t work so well because much of the reference material isn&#8217;t text, but images of text. Keep up the great work!</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Much obliged.</p>
<p>There are also new <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/wiki/RecentBuilds">distros</a> out for Windows and Linux today.</p>
<p>OS X has a few critical bugs preventing release, but will be done in a day or so.</p></div>

<p>Are you planning to make shoes a gem very time soon?</p>
<p>I guess if shoes is a gem, then shoes app can be released as gem too.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Shoes isn&#8217;t shipped as a gem cause it&#8217;s a ruby distro, it&#8217;s got everything you need all packaged up, makes distributing your app easier.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>That&#8217;s very reasonable. However, before I release my own shoes app, if I want to play with Shoes or poke around other shoes app, downloading as gems is easier for me cuz I already have ruby installed.  IMHO , ideally, I should be able to do</p>
<p>gem install shoes<br>
gem install tetris<br>
shoes tetris</p>
<p>I would have to navigate to ruby/lib/../gems/../tetris directory to read tetris&#8217; source code but that&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents :-)</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Meh, I think it&#8217;s nice how it&#8217;s all sandboxed, right now it&#8217;s basically as simple as:  extract, make  VIDEO =1, make install, shoes tetris.shy<br>
It seems like less work to me than having to dive way down into the ruby directories to add libs or run samples. Plus, you can throw it on a thumb drive, and have a little portable shoe factory. I think the benefits outweigh the easyness of a gem, though the project is really in its infancy right now, so who knows, maybe once things are a little further along we will see a gem version. :)</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>And better than a gem version will be stable debs, rpms, ebuilds and so on.</p>
<p>So, could be:</p>
<pre>
 apt-get install shoes
 shoes @the-shoebox.org/tetris
</pre></div>
