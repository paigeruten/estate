  <div class="content"><p>Despite all the clicking that has been done on a certain star.gif, I really don&#8217;t think Ruby is coming to Google&#8217;s App Engine.  Google doesn&#8217;t have much of a toe in the Ruby scene and App Engine is clearly entrenched in Python technologies (such as Pypy and WSGI).  Well, cripes.</p>
<p>But, for my purposes, I am really enticed by App Engine, because it gives beginners a supremely cinchy way to make a web app.</p>
<p>So, maybe let&#8217;s just convert Ruby 1.9 bytecode to Python 2.5 bytecode and decompile.  In other words: put in a .rb and get out a .pyc.  Yes, could work?</p>
<hr />

<h2>A Drop of Puts</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with converting the most trivial Ruby app to an App Engine script.  A translation of the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/helloworld.html">intro code</a> in the App Engine docs.</p>

<pre><code class="rb">puts "Content-Type: text/plain"
puts
puts "Hello, world!"
</code></pre>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got Ruby 1.9 installed, you can output the bytecode for this script by looping through the arrays that come out of <code>VM::InstructionSequence</code>.  Here&#8217;s the code from my <code>rb-compile</code> script:</p>

<pre><code class="rb">#!/usr/bin/env ruby
iseq = VM::InstructionSequence.compile(IO.read(ARGV[0]))
iseq.to_a.last.each do |inst|
  p inst
end
</code></pre>
<p>When I run <code>./rb-compile hello.rb</code>, the bytecode dump is:</p>

<pre><code class="rb">1
[:putnil]
[:putstring, "Content-Type: text/plain"]
[:send, :puts, 1, nil, 8, nil]
[:pop]
2
[:putnil]
[:putstring, ""]
[:send, :puts, 1, nil, 8, nil]
[:pop]
3
[:putnil]
[:putstring, "Hello, world!"]
[:send, :puts, 1, nil, 8, nil]
[:leave]
</code></pre>
<p>The numbers are line numbers.  I&#8217;m going to skip those for now, but Python bytecode has a place for those as well.  (And, in fact, you can read about all of that in Ned Batchelder&#8217;s <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200804/the_structure_of_pyc_files.html">The Structure of .pyc Files</a>.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just going to morph these messages into Python method calls.  But one problem with this bytecode: the receiver of <code>puts</code> is <code>nil</code>.  You see all those <code>:putnil</code> lines?  Since there&#8217;s no receiver, Ruby sees these as Kernel methods.</p>
<p>Instead, when pythongineering this code, let&#8217;s send all these methods to a <code>Kernel</code> class, where we can store the Ruby built-ins.  The resulting py-bytecode for a single method call will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>36 LOAD_NAME                0 (Kernel)
39 LOAD_ATTR                1 (puts)
42 LOAD_CONST               4 ('Hello, world!')
45 CALL_FUNCTION            1
</code></pre>
<p>This is really the largest challenge when converting rbc to pyc.  The ordering of things.  In Ruby, the message name is part of the <code>:send</code> instruction.  However, in Python, the method name is popped on to the stack, right after the receiver.</p>
<p>But, hey, that&#8217;s all the fun of it, right?</p>
<p>And, so, we store in Kernel.py:</p>

<pre><code class="py">def puts(*args):
  for x in args: print x
  if not args: print
</pre></code>

<hr />

<h2>Getting Unholy</h2>
<p>Okay, to watch the above take place, you&#8217;ll need to download Unholy, the Ruby-to-<span class="caps">PYC</span> converter I&#8217;m working on.  The project is <a href="http://github.com/why/unholy">here</a>.  <strong><span class="caps">HEED</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span>: It needs Ruby 1.9 and Python 2.5.</strong></p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ git clone git://github.com/why/unholy.git
$ cd unholy
$ vim hello.rb
$ bin/unholy hello.rb
$ PYTHONPATH=python python hello.rb.pyc
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, great, we&#8217;ve got some Ruby compiling to Python bytecode!  (The <span class="caps">PYTHONPATH</span> var is there to get our Kernel.py loading.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t just upload the .pyc files to Google&#8217;s machines.  How about we generate some Python source code for this?</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m using a patched version of decompyle, which still has some issues, but let&#8217;s get it installed.</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ cd unholy/decompyle
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
$ decompyle hello.rb.pyc > hello.py
</code></pre>
<p>And, there you are, the <code>hello.py</code> should amount to:</p>

<pre><code class="py"># emacs-mode: -*- python-*-
import Kernel
Kernel.puts('Content-Type: text/plain')
Kernel.puts()
return Kernel.puts('Hello, world!')

# local variables:
# tab-width: 4
</pre></code>

<hr />

<h2>Yeah So Puts is Useless</h2>
<p>Now, I admit, I&#8217;m not that far into this idea.  And, you know, I can&#8217;t see this thing holding my attention for another four hours.  But I am close to running <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/usingwebapp.html">this script</a>.  The main problem is inheriting from <code>webapp.RequestHandler</code>, which Ruby sees as a chained Kernel method call.</p>
<p>The code I&#8217;m working off of looks like this so far:</p>

<pre><code class="rb">import "wsgiref.handlers"
from "google.appengine.ext", "webapp" => :WebApp

class MainPage < WebApp::RequestHandler
  def get
    self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/plain'
    self.response.out.write('Hello, webapp World!')
  end
end


def main
  application = WebApp::WSGIApplication.new([tuple('/', MainPage)])
  wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler().run(application)
end

if __FILE__ == $0
  main
end
</pre></code>
<p>So, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do if I were you and I (playing you) wanted this to be perfectly class act.  I would call up the JRuby guys and get them to write a compiler backend for targetting Python bytecode.  I&#8217;ll bet they could crank this out in two licks of an anteater&#8217;s tongue.</p>
<p>What amazes me is how close Ruby 1.9 bytecode and Python 2.5 bytecode are.  Some things translate almost directly.  It is completely obvious that Koichi took his cues from Python.  Storing argcount, nlocals, stacksize first.  Marshalling bytecodes.  Storing classes and methods as nested bytecode fragments.</p>
<p>And, really, if that&#8217;s true (and I vouch that it is truly, truly true,) then how are Python and Ruby still on separate runtimes?  All of these bogus scaling wars and indented code battles are a huge waste of time.  Do we <em>still</em> have to be better than each other in 2008?  No way, Rufus said, &#8220;Be excellent to each other.&#8221;  Very slight (albeit legit) syntax choices, people.</p>
<p>Now, imagine a hypothetical <code>potion</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ potion hello.py
HELLO FROM PYTHON
$ potion hello.rb
KONNICHIWA FROM RUBY
</code></pre>
<p>Neither of us stands a chance against Javascript.  Why persist with this pitiful feud?</p>

    <div class="content"><p>Speaking as a Python guy, I agree with you that the Python and Ruby camps fight <em>way</em> more than they ought to. For whatever reason, I&#8217;ve never liked Ruby&#8217;s syntax (Maybe it&#8217;s that I learned Python first? Who knows), but I&#8217;ve always respected that it&#8217;s a damn fine language and people who choose Ruby are still making a Good Choice. I don&#8217;t like Rails much (or Django, for that matter), but I always try to remember that Ruby != Rails.</p>
<p>Potion sounds absolutely awesome. The best part of a combined runtime isn&#8217;t really the code savings; it&#8217;s the potential for a good bytecode <em>optimizer</em>. With the best and brightest people from both the Python and Ruby communities working on an optimized runtime, the sky&#8217;s the limit for what could be done.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>L</strong> and <strong>Charles</strong>: My concern with Parrot is that it (like .Net and Java) is a people pleaser, promising everything to everyone, eager to serve every language equally.  Well, except they each have their true intended targets: Perl 6 for Parrot, C# for .Net and Java for the  JVM .</p>
<p>To be fair, general purpose VMs do work.  They do perform computations! JRuby has really pulled off some amazing things.  I have no power of prediction, but Java will probably never be the ultimate platform for Ruby.  As long as Java is outside the kernel, it seems the most desirable platform (for purposes of speed, linkage and lightness of distro) will be native.  And you can&#8217;t just go with a bare interpreter, so I think the strategy will continue to be a VM, tailored to the language.</p>
<p>Which is probably a good argument for Ruby sticking with its own VM, despite its proximity to Python&#8217;s.  Fortunately, arguments have no place in this friendly land of peace.</p>
<p><strong>Funny</strong> and <strong>Avi Bryant</strong>: Instead of asking &#8220;can unholy run Rails?&#8221; try asking &#8220;can unholy run 4 plus 7?&#8221;  And my answer to that is: no, no, no, no, it probably can&#8217;t!!</p></div>
