<p>Rubyists love life. Boy, I tell you. They love humans. They love cars!! They looooooove dishes of real, actual food. You don&#8217;t even know. Airplanes in mid-air, refueling? They love that!</p>
<p>But, more importantly, Rubyists love pups. Baby dogs, man! Ever heard of em? Little dogs rock!!</p>
<p>Okay, wait, no. No, please hold, I can&#8217;t seem to find a citation for that. I mean, speaking for myself, I definitely like dogs. And I&#8217;ve heard tell of dogs in other places&#8230; Okay, well, how about, yeah, yeah here, let&#8217;s say a tentative <em>yellow light</em> interest in dogs. And we&#8217;ll green light that puppy if the blogosphere goes all taggy on us and there&#8217;s like a thousand delicious tags on this post that say <code>rooby-roo</code>!</p>
<hr />

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://richkilmer.blogs.com/ether/2008/10/striving-for-civility-in-the-ruby-and-rails-community.html">Rich Kilmer</a>: I propose that we demand civility in the Ruby and Rails community.</p>

<p>I have a neighbor who demands peace and quiet. He&#8217;d kill all of us if it would bring some sanity. He&#8217;s a brutal peacemaker that one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s smart, though. Really, truly, war is the only way to achieve peace. You have to get people totally sick of violence.</p>
<p>So, without further ceremony: I demand civility. But, boy, oh hot snacks, the lawlessness of these people is amazing! It&#8217;s like when you&#8217;d play army men as kids. You&#8217;d go, &#8220;You&#8217;re dead! I got you!&#8221; And the other kid&#8217;d go, &#8220;No, my guy can fly!&#8221; And you&#8217;d go, &#8220;No, who says?&#8221; And his guy is already fortifying a whole new pavilion way on top of the bookshelf.</p>
<p>Please. Stay on the ground. This is a decorated army veteran who fought for his country. And, no, he will not have his medals tarnished by allowing himself to get caught in that cunning old web of deceit that <em>is</em> the so-called Pretending To Fly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s like Jesus. Except Jesus never had the forthrightness and temerity to actually kick a guy in the jugular if he had to.</p>
<p>Zed is Gandhi. Zed is Che Guevara. And Zed is Morpheus. But, also, Zed is Daniel Larusso. Immediately following that, he&#8217;s Slim Shady. Ergo, Zed is Hannah Montana.</p>
<p>Cool, we&#8217;re making progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/d2h/status/1015351238">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>: Let me take out one of my favorite words for the occasion: Who the fuck cares? Just put it on ignore, like you would any troll fest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rubyists live by this creed: DO <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">FEED</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TROLLS</span>. Trolls are&#8230; how you say&#8230; unsavory people? Rubyists are <span class="caps">VERY</span> nice people. Always gladhanding and passing around the Lifesavers. Here, have one. We know other nice people when we see them. Nice people talk to each other. It&#8217;s way addictive. It&#8217;s great! (It&#8217;s completely social.)</p>
<hr />

<p>Let me put it this way. Suppose you&#8217;ve got Zed Shaw. No, wait, say you&#8217;ve got &#8220;a person.&#8221; (We&#8217;ll call this person &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221; for the sake of this exercise.) And you look outside and this young teen sensation is yelling, throwing darts at your house and peeing in your mailbox. For reals. You can see it all. Your mailbox is soaked. Defiled. The flag is up.</p>
<p>Now, stop and think about this. This is a very tough situation. This young lady has written one of <span class="caps">THE</span> premiere web servers in the whole wide world. Totally, insanely <span class="caps">RFC</span> complaint. They give it away on the street, but everyone knows its secretly worth like a thousand dollars. And there was nothing in that web server that hinted to these postal urinations.</p>
<p>Sacrebleu! Ah, the life and times of a Ruby guy. What is one to do? All you really can do is put one foot in front of the other. You&#8217;ve got to go to work. You&#8217;ve got gems to install. You&#8217;ve got agility to showcase. Sure, you&#8217;ve got some soiled envelopes open.</p>
<p>But, hey, you didn&#8217;t feed the trolls. Ten points to Gryffindor.</p>
<hr />

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/19905">matz</a>: I am afraid that it&#8217;s only in Japanese.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, you know, I really regret the whole Hpricot vs. Nokogiri thing from a few weeks back. It was for fun, but I mean, come on, there&#8217;s no question that LibXML is a better, faster <span class="caps">HTML</span> parser. I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m doing with Hpricot. It&#8217;s just a doodad. I mostly just like the name is all. Am I terrible person?</p>
<hr />

<p><em>Disclaimer: I once sat on the advisory board of DO <span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">FEED</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">TROLLS</span>.</em> (Translation: I <span class="caps">KNOW</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">SILENT</span> <span class="caps">TREATMENT</span> I <span class="caps">LEARNED</span> IT <span class="caps">MYSELF</span>. Doing business as: <span class="caps">PARDON</span> ME IF I <span class="caps">SEEM</span> <span class="caps">TOTALLY</span> <span class="caps">ALOOF</span>.) However, I resigned when Sally Struthers sent me a postcard exposing the severe malnutrition of these poor, poor virtual dwarves. It just rent my heart in twixt.</p>
<p>Now I send two thoughtful rebuttals a week to a troll in The Sheeple&#8217;s Republic of Reddit, always sure to include a few deliberate typos. Please consider contributing. Now is the time. Only you. Now?</p>
<p>So, look, Ruby is a crazy fun language (for some) and perhaps nothing more. You can get away with things that are heresy elsewhere. Maybe it&#8217;s an irresponsible language. A flimsy language. I don&#8217;t know, sheriff. The business world has its ideas about perfection. Maybe Ruby doesn&#8217;t take itself as seriously as the business world does.</p>
<p>If, after all these years, Ruby isn&#8217;t going to take itself seriously, then should I bother taking myself seriously either?</p>

<p>reminds me of the  SEA - ZIP  vs PK- ZIP  fiasco&#8230; it&#8217;s like two marketing departments declared war on each other in the court of public opinion.</p></div>

<p>And I still love (and prefer) Hpricot.  Like you said, there&#8217;s fruit in the title.</p>
<p>And have you looked at the inspect generated by Nokigiri?  Swimming through all of that text to try and find out what you&#8217;re looking at takes a lot of work.</p></div>

No. You are a great person. Hpricot rocks hard and saved my life several times at work (and we don&#8217;t even use ruby for web apps) and the guys there are like &#8220;How does this even work??&#8221;</p>
<p>btw I love hpricot and I love camping and I love shoes. Because they have one thing in common: an eloquent, creative and minimalist api. Unlike many other ruby projects.</p>
<p>&gt;I have noticed that that ruby community is much nicer than most on-line communities I’ve seen.</p>
<p>If you weren&#8217;t with us, why, the ruby community would be a mouch worse place.</p>
<p>Please, don&#8217;t be sour. Just because there are a bunch of drama queens and loudmouths in the community doesn&#8217;t mean that someone likes that for anything other than it&#8217;s entertainment value.</p>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>Dave Thomas:</strong> Trap him in a code kata of pragmastication!</p>
<p><strong>feeding the trolls:</strong> I&#8217;m not trying to make a whole lot of real points in this post, because I don&#8217;t really know what&#8217;s right or wrong or any of that. But I actually do like to &#8220;feed the trolls.&#8221; When I talk about DO  NOT   FEED   THE   TROLLS  also meaning I  KNOW   THE   SILENT   TREATMENT  I  LEARNED  IT  MYSELF , I&#8217;m kind of saying that not feeding the trolls is basically just another word for the silent treatment. It&#8217;s often just an excuse to be completely aloof. I mean that implies that you have these immense skills of perception that can determine who are trolls and who aren&#8217;t trolls.</p>
<p>The world &#8220;trolls&#8221; has kind of become like the word &#8220;terrorist,&#8221; in that it&#8217;s more about painting people in a bad light than it is about reality. Everyone trolls. To tease or to opine is to troll.</p>
<p> DHH  and Zed probably feel trolled after reading this, because no one likes being portrayed in a less-than-positive light.</p>
<p><strong>Zed:</strong> Oh, come on, keep going, I&#8217;m dying for you to take some serious shots at me! It&#8217;s roasting time. Do it. I can take it.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>Well, I think that this is not a Ruby community exclusive feature to have some drama now and then. I repeated all week that this kind of thing feels like Tanenbaum vs Torvalds a few years back, then the whole Stallman thing of &#8220; GNU /Linux&#8221;. Then we have the radical open source guys against Miguel De Icaza. It is like dealing with artists in the edge of the Renaissance. Those are all non-deterministic situations, so you can&#8217;t apply math and get a result. Politics works like that. If you have so many clever and opinionated people, you will have drama. I think it is very healthy and we should have more. This keeps Ruby relevant.</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>That&#8217;s actually quite a kind (and probably quite accurate) point to make, Akita.  I guess the drama is sort of the frothy surface of all the creative emotion brimming up from within the community.</p>
<p>_why:  I get it.  I think you are in the unique position of not taking the whole thing too seriously.  But I cringe when I read some peoples&#8217; rants &#8212; they seem to forget about the joy of coding.  Most of us still do it for fun first and foremost, and I think the whole celeb-u-coder world is creating the sort of downward spiral in peoples&#8217; lives worthy of a VH1 special&#8230;</p></div>

    <div class="content"><p>I think the easiest thing to do is to react only to code, i usually read all the &#8220;drama&#8221; that&#8217;s going on in the Ruby community, but it leaves me smiling, there&#8217;s no need to react to it since it doesn&#8217;t affect me.<br>
Then again, nobody has so far insulted me personally, only my code, and that&#8217;s fine.</p></div>

I mean, I&#8217;ve got my popcorn out, and I&#8217;m loving every minute of it, but I&#8217;m still baffled.  I mean, I&#8217;ve met all of the gladiators at least once or twice, and I can&#8217;t figure out how they all turned into gladiators.  Well, except for Chad and Dave.  I&#8217;ve never actually met them.  They didn&#8217;t seem interesting enough to bother meeting.  OH  CRAP .  I&#8217;m trolling!</p></div>

Sarah B &#8211; i&#8217;m deeply sorry that you don&#8217;t like the Bold and the Beautiful. when i was little i used to stay at my g&#8217;moms and she&#8217;d watch it every day. the adventures of Brook, Eric, Ridge&#8230; yeah, those were the days. but like i was saying, smart people aren&#8217;t always mature. mature people aren&#8217;t always smart. accept the balance and enjoy the show. remember, every word you add (yes, each of you) is just another turn in the game. the only way to &#8220;win&#8221; is the silent treatment&#8230; but thats no fun. if thats winning why would you want to?<br>

After the set Roach was so infuriated with Coleman&#8217;s music, Roach went up to Coleman and punched him in the mouth. Roach then showed up at Coleman&#8217;s house at 4am screaming threats.</p>

In fact, if _why would not want to become president it would be even more fun. And if there is no president of the UK, we gonna put that one forward on a agenda of needed law adjustments.</p>
<p>I guess there be many new laws, anyway. Serious laws. All of them. Important. Very.</p>
