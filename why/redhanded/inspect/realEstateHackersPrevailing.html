     <DIV class="entryContent"><P style="float:left"><IMG src="../images/llor.nu-c3.png" alt=""></P>


	<P>The new Rails-based board game <A href="http://llor.nu/">llor.nu</A> opened a few days ago.  If you’ve hopped on recently, you’ve probably noticed that the game is dominated by a steep curve of players who’ve crossed the $5,000,000 mark.  One of these players (alias: <STRONG>c3</STRONG>, ranked: no. 3) has been accused of hacking the site by the gamemaster Michael Buffington, <DEL>likely by scrounging through the <A href="http://dev.llor.nu/trac/browser/">source browser</A> for holes</DEL> (<EM>err, no, the hack started before the code came out…</EM>) <DEL>in the <SPAN class="caps">API</SPAN></DEL>.  And, since the site is driven by Ajax calls, the browser becomes a terminal for poking the exposed nerves.</P>


	<P>The really fun part of this is that when <STRONG>c3</STRONG> was called on it, he responded by <A href="http://forums.llor.nu/topic/show/146#448">posting</A> the following Ruby code in the forums:</P>


<PRE> @agent = Agent.new( :direction =&gt; :wide, :building_preference =&gt; :super_insane )
 @agent.run

 @agent2 = Agent.new( :direction =&gt; :high, :building_preference =&gt; :crappy )
 @agent2.run
</PRE>

	<P>So what is this?  Code from the exploit?  Browing the llor.nu code, I’m not finding any <CODE>Agent</CODE> model class.  Regardless, the idea of flashing a Ruby snip like a flick of the switchblade is pretty radical!  In all, it makes me wonder if multiplayer games can open-source like this.  If it’ll always suffer due to the intense scrutiny of the players.</P>


	<P>I think the killer advantage here is that if the saturation of llor.nu bugs you, it’s actually pretty simple to erect your own, you know?  ‘Cause I mean that street is becoming a pretty long and daunting ride for a newb.</P>


	<P class="update"> <STRONG>Update!</STRONG>  Turns out the code is from c3’s bot.  And a peace accord was struck!  It works <EM>for</EM> the masses now.  See the comments.</P></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Heh.  Actually, i’d done all this before he released the source code, and inspired by your work with mousehole, wrote an agent in a bastardized mix of JS and ruby to play the game automatically for me (the ‘agent’).</P>


	<P>Then, after he released the source (after much heckling), I became one of the main contributers to the project along with Dreamer, patching all the little holes I’d found and refactoring the hell outta the code.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Also worthy of note – c3 has admitted to me readily that there is a bot, and at first I was sort of bent out of shape (as much as I could be – he made the bot and stopped using it before the game went  OSS , and then he became a core contributor), but after thinking about it – solving the problems that bots can introduce is my responsibility. I can do things like throttle  API  calls, or detect patterns, or whatever.</P>


	<P>However, I must ultimately make it so that if a bot gets past my preventative measures, that it doesn’t kill the game for new players. That’s slightly more difficult, but still possible.</P>


	<P>Also, I need to say, the bot has been really handy for a number of reasons. While it traveled the map, it was paying players (good) but more importantly, it quickly helped point out imbalances in the economy. Having a super player is super valuable in finding flaws, and surely the bot will be introduced as a system tester later, hopefully available as part of the current source.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Yeah, that was kind of the whole point.</P>


	<P>The bot actually played the game as I would; while initially, it exploited a hole in the code (the dice roll and the actual move were separate ajax calls, so you could keep hitting ‘roll’ until you got a nice number) eventually we patched all those little things, and it was more fun to start writing behaviours for the little guy.</P></DIV></DIV>

There are plenty of boring, static games out there, but how many games are there where the rules of the virtual world can actually be changed by the players to suit their own needs?</P>


	<P>Micheal, what if you look at this as a feature rather than a bug?  This sort of hackable game would allow players to match their Ruby-wits against each other as opposed to their realestate trading prowess.  If it’s a choice between Ruby-wits and realestate (virtualestate?) prowess, I’ll choose a game of Ruby-wits every time.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P> BDR : What if it could somehow be made so that users are motivated to learn enough Ruby code to participate (without really realizing it)?  Maybe even little coding hints could be dropped from above?  The hints could be rewards for reaching certain goals, etc.</P>


	<P>There seem to be lots of possibilities.  Maybe it could be made ‘Matrix-like’ such that you have a sort of virtual, projected world that most players think is the ‘real world’, but in reality there’s this matrix underlying everthing and that matrix is Ruby code.  The most adept players would be those who can switch back and forth between the two (basically, this is what happened when c3 hacked the game, he became the Neo).  Call it <B>Plato’s VirtualEstate Cave!</B> or maybe <B>Ruby’s Cave</B>?... or even  llor.nu</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>&lt;|:{: (note, I feel weird addressing you with mere punctuation, but here goes) – the idea from the very beginning was that the current interface to llor.nu is just that – an interface. An  API  will be widely available, and people will be encouraged to do whatever they like. At some point I’ll have to figure out how to balance the “super interface” issue that gives smart programmers some kind of edge with the stay at home mom’s or office workers who simply want something fun to do in some spare time.</P>


	<P>Also, regarding the “matrix like” thing – I’m very much a fan of The Street as depicted in Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash, and I think the core contributors, while perhaps not as zealous as me, are understanding that you can have things like Square  &gt; Building &gt; Hotel &gt; Super Insane or Square &gt; Building &gt; Arcade &gt; 80’s Classics or whatever. Because it’s Ruby, we should be able to do that right? A square shouldn’t just be able to have a building, and a building shouldn’t just be a hotel. I dream about the day when someone can do something entirely unique and add it to the game, and it makes the entire thing all the more fun.</P>


	<P>That kind of thing supports my ultimate goal – this isn’t about fancy programming. It’s about squeezing a lot of fun out of something simple and elegant. Fancy programming can make that more possible, but my ultimate aim is to get the game to be so much fun that the entire Internet has real estate in llor.nu of some kind, and it stops the entire Internet from working for at least 20 minutes a day.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>In light of Michael’s post, I should clarify my last statement (though it still stands).  Right now, it has a very limited focus as a light, casual real estate game with the object being to get the most money.  When you take away these limitations, however, you really change the character of the game, and end up changing also the type of audience attracted.  The market for this stuff isn’t going to stay the same when you make the focus less on building hotels and making money and more on lots of other things.  The other problem, is that since you plan on going eventually with an  MMO , is the eventual ravages of griefers.  These people, armed with the ability to manipulate the code, will have a potentially disastrous means to ruining the experience of the other players by exploits, bugs, or just plain altering the coding to allow for, say, a virus to be distributed, killing the experience.   MMO ’s are not easy things to handle by the very fact that they allow for so many people.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>The fact he’s got little cash means he’s either rolling a lot while managing to avoid the quickies and the 5ks, or that he’s reinvesting his money immediately.</P>


	<P>I don’t remember seeing him in my last transactions, so I doubt he’s rolling much. If he had been reinvesting, his network would climb faster than, say, mine.</P>

	<P>But enough about that (though it is serious if he is using something to boost his performance), I’m glad to know you’re keeping these issues in mind, and I do think that the custom models would be cool.  I just also don’t trust my fellow Internet fiends to do the right thing 100% of the time, so I feel caution can’t be emphasized enough.  Also, (not to discourage you by any means) even if only .0003% of the Internet shows up at your door daily, you’re still going to need bigger and better servers (yes, plural.. don’t believe me?  Take a look at www.kingdomofloathing.com, it has three [and actually has either gained a fourth recently or is working on a fourth]).</P></DIV></DIV>
