	</BLOCKQUOTE>


	<P>I have a solid four years of work ahead of me on Hackety Hack, which is in my mind a very primitive tool, but hey the discussion is igniting.  And among people who I haven’t encountered before, yeahhh!!  One common theme is: where do you start teaching someone?  (Brian D. pointed out <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_%28learning_theory%29">Constructivism</A> on the HH mailing list.)</P>


	<P>I’m not really sure, actually.  Who really knows if H-ety H goes about things in a sensible way.  I was a very bad student myself and am often occupied with ideas which are widely acknowledged as ill-conceived.  So, today, I’m surprised at the feelings of goodwill pouring in for Hackety Hack, but I suspect waves of criticism are forthcoming, which will be quite stimulating indeed.</P>


<HR>


	<P>I designed HH with two of my very good friends in mind, <EM>Oliver Mooradian</EM> and <EM>A. Woolsey</EM>.  The second friend, <EM>A.</EM>, was taking a university beginning Java class.  The culminating exercise of his class was to read a comma-separated address book into memory.  His program was nearly one-hundred lines long.   <STRONG>And he wrote it knowing that he would never use it again.</STRONG>  As a reminder: it is the year 2007.</P>


	<P>I didn’t think I had many strong opinions about the way things <EM>should</EM> be.  But this infuriated me!!  This is not programming!!  It should not be acceptable in 2007 for students to write a program which isn’t somehow useful to them.  Not when we all use computers and are already employing micro-hacks (emoticons, bbcode, email addresses, etc.) everyday.</P>


	<P><EM>A.</EM> was also subject to a lot of mathematical programs: drawing circles, computing distances, a lot of spreadsheet-style activity.  This sounds like academic drilling.  Surely this can wait until after you’ve tinkered with <SPAN class="caps">RSS</SPAN> feeds and written a blog.</P>


	<P>I can’t say, though.  I personally only really use math for pagination and pointer arithmetic.  Tell me: are math and programming intertwined much these days??</P></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>What you’re doing is inspiring as hell. But how many people are going to use blog software they wrote themselves? There are lots of blog software out there already. Besides, to use any blog stuff at all, you need to have some kind of web hosting. Chat software isn’t likely to be used again either, because for the software to be valuable to you, everyone else has to be using it too. (I’m not sure of what chat system you have them implement, I haven’t actually played with Hackety Hack yet, sorry. If it’s just an  IRC  client or something, consider what I said withdrawn.) Everything that someone would want to use again, someone else has already written, and better! This is the curse of open source software.</P>


	<P>I do think opening up the shallow end of programming in useful ways is a great idea, but what is that shallow end? I think even  RSS  is too new and sudden for someone who has never programmed before. What does someone who doesn’t know computers know about computers? The Web, maybe files? Maybe you can add some kind of sound/video component, a la Squeak? Change the frequency of MP3s and stuff like that?</P>


	<P>Of course, since you’re already getting great results from young people, I guess that means you know what you’re doing better than I do!</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>It depends on the type of programming.  That said, most programs (or pieces of programs) can be roughly categorized as performing a computation or manipulating data.  While most bottom-up teaching approaches focus on the computation, a top-down approach should focus on the data.</P>


	<P>My first computer science class was <A href="http://berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</A>’s  CS61A .  The class was taught using Scheme and for the first month we did very little with numbers.  In fact, I think the only time arithmetic was covered was in relation to that in Scheme you write <CODE>(+ 2 3)</CODE> instead of <CODE>2 + 3</CODE>.  The Scheme dialect we used (STk, a  PLT  derivative) had an abstract data type of words and sentences based on  LOGO .  Instead of adding numbers, we constructed sentences and worked with text.  Although the text-book (SICP, one of the best ever) introduces programming in the context of mathematics, the Professor felt starting with a more familiar concept would be helpful.  He was probably right.</P>


	<P>Another successful data-centric approach is in Smalltalk and Squeak.  Alan Kay designed Smalltalk with children in mind, and some of the programs 12-year olds were able to create were pretty phenomenal.</P>


	<P>In short, steal as much as you can from Smalltalk and  LOGO  (a Lisp) and teaching material written for them.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>I think that the reason that the Uni. curriculum is so heavy math is that:</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Is math and programming intertwined?  Depends on what you’re looking for!</P>


	<P>As a mechanical engineering major, we have a class called Computational Methods that is dedicated to the study of using numerical methods (algebra, etc.) in order to solve higher math such as differentials, integration, and differential equations.  Our instructor also has us implement what we learn into Maple procedures so that we can learn how these equations and methods are applied to programming.</P>


	<P>Learning how numerical methods goes along with programming is very important since you can’t do direct integration and such directly in C or Ruby or most any other languages!</P>


	<P>We use Maple (and now Matlab) for two reasons:
1.) They’re integrated environments that aren’t going to scare newbies away.
2.) They’ll pop back up later on when we enter industry.</P>


	<P>Now, to answer your question, it really depends on the area you’re working in.  For most Mech E’s, programming is this really scary thing that you just <EM>have</EM> to use to get through Computational Methods.  There have been many days in class that I’ve stopped and said “Hey, that’s easy to make parallel!” or “Hey, I know how I could implement that!”</P>


	<P>There’s a lot to do with programming and math.  It’s just that most people don’t like the math or don’t like the programming.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>It depends on the type of programming.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>




	<P>I think that’s exactly it.  Math is essential for financial, graphing, image manipulation, 3D applications, etc., but not so important for a blog or about 90% of the stuff I personally do.</P>


	<P>I find most of my bastard code children are single-use-ish and don’t use mathematics beyond simple calculations.</P>


	<P>Another reason a custom-written blog or internet-facing application shouldn’t be used for beginning programming students would be security.  It’s hard ‘nuff to catch the tricky stuff when you know how things are s’posed to work… let alone when you’re trying to come up with the basic functionality to begin with.  Ie.- beginning programming students don’t really start with boundary checking and testing.</P>


	<P>But yeah… where DO you start?  There has to be some degree of bootstrapping.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Greetings,</P>


	<P>I am strongly opposed to teaching math as being a key part of programming.  I consider it a vile and vicious conspiracy on the part of the Math professors who ended up being the ones in charge of this new ‘Computer’ thing back whenever.</P>


	<P>I feel  EXTREMELY  strongly that programming is a language skill, not a math skill.  Just like writing or any other form of communication sometimes you need to know the lingo for a specific field (e.g. math in computer graphics), but at the core you need to be good at stringing together a coherent sentence.  If you do it for a while, you’ll need to be good at fundamental logic  At the core though it’s all in service to a linguistic skill.</P>


	<P>Sure, it’s good to be exposed to business math, because a great deal of the work out there involves terminology which is extracted from there, but unless you go into CG, you still won’t need anything particularly fancy.</P>


	<P>To wax non-nostalgic, I always considered it extremely annoying for intro-to-programming books (which used  BASIC ) to start by teaching you ‘read’ and ‘data’, instead of ‘print’ and ‘input’.  That’s not the way to teach folks the positive feedback loop of programming.  (Write something, see things happen, get excited, make changes, see more things happen!)</P>


	<P>I <STRONG>love</STRONG> HH, by the way.  We’ve been having discussions around the office and at home about what age it’s good to try to introduce kids to it.  (My wife still likes Logo for very young kids, but we agree that this is a good second step, or first step for older kids.)</P>

Even more are programmers confronted with something (sorting, databases, ...) that strongly depends on mathematics.

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Basic math skills (including basic algebra) are essential (and we take them for granted), and the child has to have a pretty good grasp of that, when  diving into programming, so that it doesn’t become a road-block to progress. But in a program like HH, I think that teaching logic is more important. (I’m thinking specifically of a child, not a teenager 13+. Actually, _why, I think HH would be better positioned at a younger age group, say 9 or 10+ instead of 13. By 13 they’re already picking it up on their own if they have an aptitude, or there’s other tools they can use that they can grasp. The hard part is starting them off younger—which yields better results in the long run.</P>


	<P>I also think that a tool like HH should focus not on providing the child with the building blocks to create whatever it they want to create, rather than creating them for them. In other words, I’m not sure that supplying them with build-in methods so that they can build a blog in 6 lines in the best approach in the long run. They have to understand what they’re doing and how they can apply that knowledge to building something else. Start very simple-<DEL>object, properties, methods</DEL>-once you understand how to create and manipulate them, then the child can make whatever they want from scratch. The trick is providing an environment (like HH) that makes it easy for them to understand and “build” using those blocks, without creating a dependency on the tool. I admire you for tackling this, _why. An important task.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>To answer the q at end of the main post – how intertwined are progging and maths?  Depends what you need, i think.  What level of abstraction are you working at in your program?  The vast majority of programmers can get by there entire career without any need to know any maths.  Where the need does come in it tends to be at a comp sci level (discrete maths), or specialised domains (where only some particular maths discipline is required).  So, in general for 99% they aren’t intertwined.</P>


	<P>Would it be good to be able to use HH to help those who want to use or teach math in/using progging? – sure!
But so would lot’s of other stuff.</P>


	<P>I think that why’s opting web oriented environment makes sense for a couple of reasons.  First, one of the real drivers seems to be the desire to get a sharing based community going, this needs some of the web functionality anyway if you want it integrated with the HH environment, secondly the potential audience of people willing to pick up and try HH to utilise in new ways web resources they are already familiar with is, to me, a potentially larger group than those who may be motived by maths or even game dev (it may also encapsulate the majority of groups too, where the converse may not be the case).</P>


	<P>What would be cool is if the HH community could develop the modules they want to see included, and HH allow users to plug in the modules they want.If all modules had to have tutorial resources as well as programmatic ones, then we could wind up in a situation where we could have distribution of HH with a base set of modules built in, and mechanism for users to plug in new ones they’d like to use – all complete with tutorial resources so that <STRONG>every</STRONG> HH module is a tool for learning as well as programming.</P>


	<P>This would let people who want to learn maths in a programming context have the HH they want, and the game dev folk, and the web folk… but all still one big HH community.</P></DIV></DIV>

Math concepts were important at one time when you had to work at the machine language level and worked directly in memory registers and buffers, et al.

The programmer is free to work on problem solution and is not required to know the inner workings of the computer. 
The one thing we all can agree on is that their are many people who love math and just as many who don’t. If you are a programmer programming a computer you are without doubt programming a solution to a problem. If that problem requires mathematics to help solve it then the programmer had best know mathematics and the tools you choose to build your solution on the computer must be capable of the same.</P></DIV></DIV>

		<P>A number has personality, but it’s single-faceted compared to other more diverse objects. So I guess objects which hold great weight in the student’s mind makes for an equation which is more about the pratical ideas in motion rather than the math itself.</P>

	<P>The key here is <I>“objects which hold great weight in the student’s mind”</I>. So much of CS, Math, and education is about <B>stuffing</B>, <I>jamming</I>, and <U>cramming</U> unrelated foreign tiddly-winks into the student’s mind, when most of what is needed is a good analogy.</P>


	<P>Also, I might add, one of the reasons I love numbers so much is that one single number has practically infinite meanings, attributes, etc. I see them as incredibly dense objects… is it a square? Is it prime? Is it the year I was born? I think this is why I feel such a primal connection to programming and information in general, to see something so simple but know there’s an infinity within it.</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>_why: As an art/humanities-inclined person who learned programming very recently, what you said above about the “personality” of objects really strikes home with me. The most important skill I’ve found/learned in programming is ‘modeling’: figuring out how to combine objects into a useful representation of the world (or at least the part of it related to the software I’m trying to write). That’s why having projects in domains I was interested in (I got into programming because I wanted to distribute <A href="http://atduskmusic.com/">my music</A> on the internet) was an absolute necessity when I was getting started—if I didn’t already know something about the domain and care about it, I never would have gotten past the starting line. I think this is why your idea of helping kids do things they already really want to do is so promising.</P>

The most successful day-to-day programmers (like the most successful salespeople, or finance guys, or CPAs, or marketers) are the ones with the best grasp of language; both in terms of communicating with the team, and in thinking symbolically. Studying math helps with the latter but does bugger-all for the former. Ultimately, programming isn’t about communicating with the computer, it’s about communicating with other programmers.</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Wow.  This is a big list of stunning thoughts on what programming means to a lot of individuals.  I doubt I can add much but what the hell, it’s only bits!</P>


	<P>Thinking back on how I learned to code, there weer a few early things:</P>


	<UL>
	<LI>I think we did Logo, which to me was about drawing and mazes.  We played games, that made me want to make games soo….</LI>
		<LI>I made games in  BASIC  on my family’s win 3.1 box, but I couldn’t share them sooo….</LI>
		<LI>I made games on TI-82s.  Then we wanted multiplayer games, so I fondly remember a road trip to my friend’s grandparents where we programmed different versions of the same multiplayer game for fun.  It was cool to look at my friend’s code after and learn how he came to make the game a bit different.</LI>
	</UL>


	<P>From there I fell off a bit, made some other TI stuff, played a little with perl, and then nothing struck me till I learned  PHP , which meant I could DO things, and share them quickly.  I guess for me, sharing my code or having others toy with what I build is very important.</P>


	<P>So I guess if I was hacking on Hackity Hack, that’s what would be neat to me, the ability to save my code and beam it over to my friend.  Making games and things I can play with.  A blog is neat, but what middle school or high school kid who’s already a bit nerdy really wants a blog?  Where the heck do they host it?  No, games it is.</P>


	<P>I also agree with PJ that CS doesn’t teach communication and real world team-work, but I don’t think that’s really in the scope of Hackity Hack, from the little I’ve seen.  Being a self-taught developer steeped in team projects, working with CS majors who could whoop my ass in math often requires a lot of hand holding.</P>


	<P>And I agree with Morgan that, at least for me, programming is a language skill.  It’s a communication medium.  It is a tool yes, but it is a tool like my french horn is a tool, or my mandolin, or my writing.  I know for some of my friends it’s not the same, people into Mathmatica and systems at Google.  For them the magic seems more about the complex problems they can translate and attack in simple code.  Maybe.</P>


	<P>Joy!  Hackity Hack considered neat-o, but man, a software synth where you can make music and sounds like you can draw in logo would be awfully killer too :-).</P>


	<P>Good hacking!</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Let me start off: Math? Eww!</P>


	<P>Let me revise. Math teaching? Eww!</P>


	<P>I had the fortune to not learn math the traditional way. I didn’t learn abstract problems. I’ve never done much formal algebra. I’m working on calculus now, because it’s interesting for what I’m learning.</P>


	<P>But I didn’t learn formal algebra, the so-called prerequisite.</P>


	<P>I learned trigonometry first.</P>


	<P>At this point, I’d been programming computers for a fair number of years (I started at age 6, on my  TI 99 -4a. And I started with text manipulation, because we had the speech synthesizer addition.) I had an idea what variables were. I had a good idea how to twist the symbols around programatically. I could do what one might consider algebra, on the computer. But I wasn’t thinking about balanced equations and transformations—that came later when I wrote a wiki, and I thought about it textually. I was trying to get things to add up right to make the game world the right size. I was trying to make pretty colors (16 Bit!). I learned binary arithmetic.</P>


	<P>But then I had to learn trigonometry.</P>


	<P>And there was a reason for this.</P>


	<P>We were building a house. And we’re not talking 16-inch-center studs, slap two up around every doorway cookie-cutter house, we were Building A House. Out of big timbers and straw bales.</P>


	<P>And it had to not fall down. There’s no book of The Way You Must Do This that’s pre-approved, no thought required. There’s a bunch of engineering books. Some of them quite accessible. We had to make a plan and get an engineer to approve it.</P>


	<P>So we did. My dad and I learned trigonometry together. We paced around timber and computer models. We learned about force vectors. We learned how the triangular structure of the house would distribute the loads.</P>


	<P>I wrote a few programs then to figure some parts out. If I’d had Ruby at the time, I’d have used Ruby. But I had Quattro. And AutoCAD. And we made it work.</P>


	<P>I’d been programming for years before I did much more than counting, mathematically, with it. I learned math, not by being taught abstractions, but by having a real physical use for it.</P>


	<P>Oh, and the house is still standing. And it doesn’t shake in the wind like the one we lived in before did.</P>


	<P>Really, math is shapes and transformations and patterns and relationships. The way it’s taught is manipulations on abstract symbols and so wholly unapplied that it’s painful to watch.</P>


	<P>Programming, the way I learned, however, was fun. I wrote a wiki. I wrote text tools. I chopped words up in all sorts of ways. I wrote madlib generators. Lists of words, lists of sentences, lists of paragraphs. Yes, you can count elements in a list. Yes, you can think of the elements as symbols in a set alphabet.</P>


	<P>But when it comes down to it, programming words is fun. And math is better when applied, either manipulating graphics or lumber. Teaching it in the abstract is boring. Really, really boring.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>I agree with bortels: Creating games is what kids can really get off on. My daughter might be interested in programming her own blog (she did design her own website from scratch), but what really interests her are little games, or programs that perform functions that are useful to her. (Ie, she wrote, with help from dad, a Ruby program that tests her on her times tables, with high scores, etc. because she has a hard time with that (9 yrs old). Or a silly little program that tells you your Chinese zodiac sign when you input the year you were born. Stuff like that.)</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>Chat software isn’t likely to be used again either, because for the software to be valuable to you, everyone else has to be using it too. (I’m not sure of what chat system you have them implement, I haven’t actually played with Hackety Hack yet, sorry. If it’s just an  IRC  client or something, consider what I said withdrawn.)</P>

	<P> XMPP  too.  The days of IM systems needing to be incompatible are long gone.  Anyone writing a new client that doesn’t support  XMPP  needs a bullet in the head before they release it.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>I think most people here are missing the point – the kind of math you need to know in order to be a competent programmer is not necessarily the kind of math behind the calculations your code may or may not be doing. Whether you’re writing 3D games or business intelligence applications that call 2312 different web services, knowledge of a number of concepts in discrete mathematics is extremely important. You may have learned it in the context of a formalized framework or picked it up as random tidbits, but, as a programmer, you know and use a fair amount of discrete maths in your daily work.</P>


	<P>Math is much more than trig and calculus!</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>I got a C for math at high school level, and didn’t really like anything I was taught, more because of the way it was taught than anything else I guess.</P>


	<P>Now that I’m back at university after 7 years of working as a developer, studying  mathematics along with my CS subjects, I’m really enjoying it, and my grades are much much better :)</P>


	<P>I agree with the poster who recommended applied math though, it’s far more interesting if you can see how it is being used to solve real problems.</P>


	<P>Make things as simple as possible, but no simpler – I really dislike the trend to infantilize everything these days. Some things aren’t easy, that doesn’t mean understanding them isn’t worth doing.</P>


	<P>Have a look at some of the undergraduate coursework at  MIT  (OpenCourseWare). If you’re having trouble doing that, that’s ok, but these are going to be the grads that get the really interesting jobs, working on stuff that actually advances the state of the art, instead of building the social networking phenomenon in the hopes of selling to a bigger company :)</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>While I agree that math is important to programming, so is having a way to get young people interested in programming for fun.  </P>


	<PRE><CODE>I started programming from a book of games written in basic for an apple IIe (dating myself I know).  I was 12 years old at the time.  I typed in the games as they were in the book and then had to teach myself how to debug my typos just to get them running.  It was self motivating.  Once I figured out I could change things I began playing with the code.  Before long I was pretty good at basic.  Over the years I have continued and now program in over 15 different languages most of which were self taught.  I have no college degree, but make a 6 figure income as a senior level software engineer for a fotune 100 company.  
I only tell you this to keep you motivated with what you are doing.  You never know what door you are opening for someone.  If it is enticing even one young mind to learn, it is a worth while cause.</CODE></PRE></DIV></DIV>
