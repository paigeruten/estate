</DIV>

     <DIV class="entryContent"><P>In an article posted entitled <A href="http://www.bitwisemag.com/2/What-s-Wrong-With-Ruby">What’s Wrong With Ruby?</A>, the author cites me as one of the main problems:</P>


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>If I was put off Ruby by the hype, I was put off more by the many cutesy introductory tutorials I encountered when trying to get into it.  Why’s (Poignant) Guide is a particular horrid example… I don’t want someone chatting away to me and telling me how “cool” it all is (I’ve lived long enough as a computer programmer to know it’ll never really be “cool” to be one). I just want the straight facts, plainly put.</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>


	<P>These are such great points and so well-put.  See, actually, I’ve known since birth that I’m a problem, so this is no surprise to me.  As a child, I caused a giant meadow fire that all the dads had to go fix!  Also, I broke a statue!  And now I’ve ruined Ruby.  Uh. Oh.</P>


	<P>If I may build on his argument for just a sec.</P>


	<P>The problem here is: the author of the article is trying to do academics, to gain knowledge, to build a career.  And my cartoons and stories have patronized him, belittled him, by treating him as if he wasn’t a real professional.  This is a terrible breach of conduct.  He has accolades innumerable.  He has done no small deed.  His peers are all gathered around him, wishing him the best and swelling with nothing but respect and esteem for him.  <EM><SPAN class="caps">NOW WHAT IS THIS CARTOON BOOK DOING HERE</SPAN>??</EM></P>


	<P>Programming is for world commerce.  It is like agriculture or fossil fuels.  It is lot a like baling hay.  I’ll give you an example: You wouldn’t write a cartoon book with a plot and running narrative just to show a guy how to bale hay!  That would frustrate the guy!  He would throw that book in the pig’s pen!  He just wants to get straight to the nitty-gritty and, for once in his life, just bale hay, straightway!</P>


	<P>Fortunately, as I’ve mentioned before, I have a strong feeling that I will die young without artifact.  That I will make no lasting impression.  This will be my avenue.  So hold your horses, I just have a few more things to do in life and I’m sure I’ll be out of your hair.</P></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>See the problem here is two-fold. Firstly, he’s not looking very hard for the “straight facts, plainly put”. I learned what I know of ruby from examples and the  API , the way all right-thinking people do, but I would have stopped at page 1 of the Pragmatic book if it hadn’t been for the Poginant one. I rather enjoyed being shown exactly why ruby was so cool.</P>


	<P>Far more importantly, he has self-admittedly closed his mind to the merest possibility of programming being cool. With a mindset like that, of <STRONG>course</STRONG> the poignant guide is going to be annoying.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>I doubt you’re fishing for a lovefest, but I’ve learned about a hundred different programming languages over the course of my life (maybe not well, but enough to write lil sample applications in each one) and I found the Poignant Guide to be my favorite learner’s guide, bar maybe Guy Steele’s Scheme book and <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Griswold">Ralph Griswold’s</A> (RIP) awesome  SNOBOL  and Icon books. I’m with the others here—I can hit ri and the Pickaxe and the mailing lists for the details, but learning with chunky bacon and Dwemthy and foxes has given Ruby a flavor for me it would otherwise lack. It’s magical and strange and wonderful and oddly dark.</P>


	<P>Furthermore, anybody who compares the Poignant Guide to the Head First guides has failed to understand the Poignant Guide altogether. There’s no false jocosity or spoonful of sugar bullcrap to the Poignant Guide. It’s like the <A href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/e-books/HP/">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</A>—it’s a legitimate work of art and literature as well as a programming manual. (It doesn’t talk about how cool Ruby is, really. Does it?)</P>


	<P>Man, I don’t know why that kind of response bugs me so much. Maybe it’s because I’ve read a lot of programming lore from the 70s and 80s, when there were a lot more weirdo geek-hippies striding the plains with their 41CXs and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer records, playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons and writing arcane articles for the Whole Earth guide when they weren’t cranking out the code. Tech writers used to be less afraid of individual expression and personalized prose, I think. Some of the old programming manuals I have in my collection read like they were written under the influence of acid and Tolkien, and these were manuals for shrink-wrapped products from big companies. I like it better that way. So many of the technical books these days are not only passionless cash-ins, that lack of passion saps them of any real desire to inform at the same time. Great! Bring them on!</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Absolutely disgusting. You are, indeed, destroying the Ruby community; you’re doing nasty and horrible things like making Ruby accessible to folks like me who have wanted to do something programming-related for a long time but haven’t had much patience for long, rambling software manuals that they didn’t understand because they hadn’t taken the courses on the jargon. Your book might even make people who weren’t interested in programming at all come along and join the community! We’d never want <EM>amateurs</EM> joining us. They might pollute the code base, you know. Especially with a guide that tells them absolutely nothing of syntax, labeling conventions, or anything important like that. My thinking is that you should just go and kill yourself now, considering all your crimes. That meadow? You killed some deer there. <EM>You</EM> are the one who killed Bambi’s parents. That statue, it was an ancient greek one, very important to the art community. Now it’s time to pay, why.</P>


	<P>But before you do go kill yourself for all your horrible crimes, would you mind writing a bit more stuff like the poignant guide, as well as more of your horrible, nasty and disgusting code, like Camping and MouseHole and all that other stuff over in the Subversion repo? I rather enjoye-... I mean, I need examples for my future classes of bad people in programming. Yeah, that.</P>


	<P>Finally, long live chunky bacon (or at least its mold colonies); and say hello to Blix for me. I’ve been missing him.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P> ARRRGH . That guy makes me crazy! I could literally write a book in response to that article (I’ve now gone off and read most of it and returned). It’s so ridiculously prescriptive and closed-minded.</P>


	<P>I’m busy evaluating a bunch of languages for a new project (for a variety of reasons, Ruby hasn’t made the list, even though I’m very fond of it) and I’m looking at a lot of these languages he talks about approvingly at the beginning (OCAML, Haskell, etc), and to use <STRONG>those</STRONG> languages requires a different style of development than the one he seems to want to teach his students. In his attention to various things (like the limitations of blocks, which he pretty clearly doesn’t fully understand) he overlooks the fact that Ruby, like Perl before it, has a fully functional core and supports closures and at least a degree of higher-order programming. So maddening!</P>


	<P>There’s a place for strong typing, there’s a place for type inference and there’s a place for duck typing. It all comes down to what best fits your hand or the task at your hand. Trying to pretend that there are objective winners in the language wars is so depressingly… I don’t know,  maybe “reactionary” is the word I’m looking for. Maybe “didactic” is another, because I think part of his dislike for the Poignant Guide comes down to the fact that he’s an academic and the Poignant Guide is by an autodidact for other autodidacts (I loved my computer science classes in school, and I have 95+% of a CS degree, but I taught myself how to program rather than learning it in school, ultimately).</P>


	<P>I love Haskell and I love Ruby at the same time. I’m gonna use them both. I think they’re both awesome and awesomely useful languages. I don’t think either one is going to make it easier to learn to program, because as dude mentions, learning to program is, always has been, and always will be, hard.</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>He epitomizes everything that’s wrong with academic computer science.</P>


	<P>Programming language research has long been sidetracked toward inventing toy languages that are primarily useful for pseudo-mathematical wanking.</P>


	<P>Unfortunately, the best possible language for pseudo-mathematical wanking (Lisp/Scheme) was invented 50 years ago.  One must never admit this, because….well… if you did, there’d be no need for “programming language research”, would there? :-)</P>


	<P>Even worse, Lisp is actually a pretty good general-purpose programming language (if a little hard for a novice to get his head around), which poses the risk that someone who writes real-world applications may run across your toy code in a journal article, resulting in much pointing and laughing.</P>


	<P>It’s better by far to invent a new language that’s only understood by the 5 guys who work in your tiny little corner of the research landscape. That way you can all peer-review each other’s papers and recommend each other for funding.</P>


	<P>It’s not an accident that only  ONE  of the widely-used languages developed over the last three decades (C, C++, Java,  PHP , Perl, Python, Visual Basic,  SQL ) came out of academia, and the lone exception (Python) was developed for prototyping, not analysis (note: I’m not saying these are all <STRONG>good</STRONG> languages, but they’re the main ones that people have used to write all those zillions of lines of useful code that make our world go).</P>


	<P>The really interesting new programming languages tend to be the  work of obsessed lone hackers (Ruby) or else come out of industry (Erlang).</P>


	<P>I’m sorry to hear about Ralph Griswold, btw. I remember coming across an ancient  SNOBOL  book in the library back in the day and deciding that  SNOBOL  rocked.  Hard. I didn’t have access to a  SNOBOL  compiler, alas, and now that time has passed.</P></DIV></DIV>

He’s right – I’ve been taken in by your cartoon foxes and your chunky bacon (mmm, bacon). I’m furious that I’ve found Ruby through your work.

I’m going back to coding websites with cobbled-together C and bash scripts – who’s with me?!?</P>

In fact, I was getting worried that the idea of conversational documentation had entirely given way to dry, unhelpful bundles of man pages and intensely product-/version-specific documentation (as popularized by a certain publisher that only puts woodcuts on the <B>covers</B> of its volumes) when I stumbled upon this thing.</P>


	<P>That said… I haven’t actually checked on its progress for a year or two, and have only given the latest installments the most cursory glance, but please tell me you’ll get to a brief overview of ‘design patterns,’ or, to the point, sane organization of a project and its main loop or equivalent.</P>


	<P>All the Ruby documentation I’ve encountered is great at demonstrating how to assemble little methods (with inheritance and all that good stuff), but leaves creating an actual ‘program’ with more complexity than a shell script as some sort of zen exercise for the reader.  We all know the language doesn’t enforce many practices; just show us some options for structure or layout that work.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>I’m a university lecturer, yes. I don’t think this makes me special. If you must know, the reason I went into academia is when I graduated I found all the fun coding jobs were defence-related, and I didn’t want to be writing programs to kill people.</P>


	<P>One thing being in this job has shown me is just how difficult most people find coding. There’s a few of us – I’m one – who find it real fun, do it naturally, love to explore new programming languages etc. But most kids – and they must have some sort of interest in computers otherwise why did they register for a CS degree – seem to find it amazingly difficult. And if you say “that’s because you’re a bad teacher”, it’s something that’s experienced across the world by whoever does it. Different people, different styles, different languages chosen, different paradigms, still the end result which almost everyone teaching intro programming on CS degrees finds is that a small proportion of the class really likes it, gets it right away, get good marks, the rest do really badly, hate it, and fail.</P>


	<P>From my experience I don’t think Ruby’s the magic solution to this. I’ve read a lot about it, tried it out, and  I STILL  don’t see why so many people think it’s some amazing thing so much better than any other programming language. It’s OK, that’s all – I’m open to be persuaded of its special nature, but when I questioned it, all I got was abuse poured on my head. Couldn’t you guys have tried to convince me instead?</P>


	<P>Sorry to Why, no doubt your stuff’s great to those who enjoy that sort of thing, but I didn’t find it helped me into the language. People trying to impose their own sense of humour on me when I’m trying to learn something doesn’t work. But if others share yours and it works for them, well, fine for them.</P>


	<P>One reason I’m looking at this is I think academic research into programming languages has been sterile for many, many years. When I look at the academic conferences, it’s all boring mathematical stuff that sends me to sleep. What interests me is practical ideas for new programming languages ordinary people can use. It seems to me all the exciting stuff on the development of new programming languages is taking place outside the universities, which is why I’m looking at places like those involved with Ruby, which is where it’s happening.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>alright, sir, you deserve an answer to that very fine question.</P>


<H2>no.</H2>


	<P>these are not university professors, lecturers, or academics, who have spent years cultivating great respect for things like decorum and the formalities of scientific study.   we’re amateurs, we’re self-taught hacks, we’re dilitantes.  and a few of us are degreed professionals as well.</P>

If he couldn’t pick that up in the first 10 seconds of knowing us, and in fact we convinced him of the opposite, we are clearly not living up to it.</P>


	<P> MMH , you stated a little more than the fact that _why’s and your senses of humor didn’t align.  You said the book was “horrid”, and that it’s symbolic of one of the biggest things wrong with Ruby.  Them’s fighting words.  As you can see in a few of the comments above, there are some people who enjoyed the book but had to do their learning elsewhere, and people who didn’t enjoy the book but learned Ruby anyway because it was awesome on its own.  It’s possible to coexist with _why’s book, regardless of your humor or whether you like Ruby. :)</P>


	<P>I agree wholeheartedly with your last point, that programming in the academic setting is becoming sterile, and making it accessible and fun again is necessary.  And indeed, if you keep your eye on the Ruby community and on _why, I’m sure you’ll find out that Ruby is exactly, as you said, where it is happening.</P></DIV></DIV>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>Setting aside our widespread outrage for the moment, I think one of the other issues raised by Herr Professor Huntback deserves particular attention—namely, that Ruby doesn’t parallelize very well: our very mutable classes, shared between threads, mean that we’ve got all kinds of synchronization points and possible contention just for a simple method call.  Multiply up, and you can see we’ve got problems.</P>


	<P>Part of the solution, as the world gets ever more parallel around us, is going to have to be something along the lines of establishing “partitions” which run in separate threads, each with their own independent set of classes and so forth.  Of course, sometimes we will want to share some objects or classes, so there would need to be some mechanism to import, or proxy, such things from one such “partition” to another.</P>


	<P>Thankfully, _why has been working on an  API  to accomplish just that: we call it <A href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/sandbox/">sandbox</A>.  Now, while  MRI  and even  YARV  haven’t gotten very parallel about their interpreters yet, JRuby already is, with its multiple interpreter contexts per process.  Combined with Ola’s JRuby implementation of that sandlish sandbox (which lets us take advantage of those multiple contexts in a single program), we’ve accomplished a major step in getting Ruby to the parallel world.  There’s lots more to do, but _why has gotten us over a very important hump.</P>


	<P>If by Huntback’s reckoning _why is wrong for Ruby, _why also demonstrably very right.</P></DIV></DIV>

I find it offensive that most people keep mentioning “cartoons” as if that is the whole point of the book. The problem is that most “fans” are guilty of the same thing as our beloved  MMH  over here. They never bothered to seriously read it as a n original work of art or literature. From all these comments about “cartoons” this and cartoons that.. it would seem that they think it is some kind of a silly ruby-for-dummies book “WITH  CARTOONS !”</P>


	<P> JEEZUZ -H-T-F-Krrrrrrrrrist! is that all you “fans” think it is? Have you even bothered to read it?

I hope he doesn’t publish his papers with the same level of “rigour” that he applied in his opinion piece.</P>

	<P>Money? Someone they respect said “computers” to them in the hushed, reverential tones that were reserved for “plastics” in ancient Dustin Hoffman movies? They got their sense of what programmers do from watching The Matrix?</P>


	<P><EM>that a small proportion of the class really likes it, gets it right away, get good marks, the rest do really badly, hate it, and fail.</EM></P>


	<P>The same is true for art school, cooking school, and probably undertaker’s school (whatever it’s called) and cosmetology.  In fact, I’d wager a large sum that the ratio of incoming students to successful careers is <B>far</B> worse for art school than it is for CS. At a minimum, the CS guys probably fail out at an earlier stage, while there’s still time to change to something else.</P>


	<P>Some people have natural talent, some don’t. We generally recognize that this is the case for art and cooking, but oddly think that programming is something that can be “taught”, regardless of inherent aptitude. Sure, just about anyone can be taught to write a for loop, just as just about everyone can be taught to draw something simple, or cook a basic meal. That won’t make him a great (or even competent) artist or chef, though. To do that he needs both talent and enough interest in the subject to practice, practice, practice.</P>


	<P>From a pedagogic perspective, I would argue that scripting languages are a  MUCH  better choice than whatever bondage-and-discipline language is in vogue in academia at the moment. Scripting language = gets working code on the screen faster = student programmer writes more code in the same amount of time. Before you can teach Java you need to spend a substantial amount of time on the mechanics of compilation and all the syntax crapola. The edit/compile/debug cycle is a major motivation trap, too, especially when someone’s first starting out. Do not underestimate the advantage of being able to type your code right into  IRB  and see it work (or not) on the spot.</P>


	<P><EM>From my experience I don’t think Ruby’s the magic solution to this.</EM></P>


	<P>There isn’t one.</P>


	<P><EM>I’m open to be persuaded of its special nature,</EM></P>


	<P>Well, you might start by writing some code that actually does something, say, recursively iterates over the file system, finds all  MP3  files, extracts the  ID3  tags, and puts them in some sort of simple database.</P>


	<P>Write it in Ruby, then rewrite it in Java, C, or (shudder) Aldwych.</P>


	<P>I write code when I need to do something, said something rarely being an elegant reimplementation of quicksort or Dijkstra’s algorithm. I like languages that let me do my stuff without strewing a lot of bullshit in my path. Ruby spreads less bullshit in my path than any language I’ve ever used (Lisp is more elegant, but the bullshit factor ramps up exponentially when you start needing to talk to libraries written in other languages).</P>


	<P>Trust me, your students will be far more motivated to write a project that lets them grab (football scores, stock prices, pictures of their favorite actor or musician) from a web site and display them in some cool way than they ever by writing quicksort or the  KMP  string matching algorithm. Do you realize how many guys are actually needed to write quicksort in today’s job market? Answer: one guy per language.</P>


	<P><EM>I didn’t find it helped me into the language.</EM></P>


	<P>“Not my cup of tea” is a long way from “horrid”. I think the Poignant Guide is pretty cool, but personally I learned from the Pickaxe book.</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>OK, here’s a fairly detailed reply to Lambda Lambada.</P>


	<P><I>
 MMH : they must have some sort of interest in computers otherwise why did they register for a CS degree</I></P><I>


	</I><P><I>LL: Money? Someone they respect said “computers” to them in the hushed, reverential tones that were reserved for “plastics” in ancient Dustin Hoffman movies?
</I></P>


	<P>No, it’s not the money these days. For a short time CS departments got a lot of applicants who though that way, but since the dot.com crash it’s been hard to recruit as there seems to be a widespread opinion that there aren’t any jobs in it, and what there are have all been outsourced from Europe/US anyway.</P>


	<P><I>
Some people have natural talent, some don’t. We generally recognize that this is the case for art and cooking, but oddly think that programming is something that can be “taught”, regardless of inherent aptitude.
</I></P>


	<P>Yes, I’m agreeing with you there, that’s one of the points I was trying to make in my article, I don’t see Ruby or any other programming language as solving this, becuase it isn’t the programming language used that’s the issue.</P>


	<P><I>
From a pedagogic perspective, I would argue that scripting languages are a  MUCH  better choice than whatever bondage-and-discipline language is in vogue in academia at the moment.
</I></P>


	<P>Yes, that’s why I’m looking at scripting languages, I happened to mention this to the editor of Bitwise magazine, and he asked me to write an article on my first impressions of Ruby after I’d spent a couple of weeks with it.</P>


	<P><I>
Before you can teach Java you need to spend a substantial amount of time on the mechanics of compilation and all the syntax crapola.
</I></P>


	<P>But Ruby has syntax as well, I don’t see the issues as so dramatically different. Sure, you lose the stuff required by Java to maintain static types, but is this really such a major issue? I don’t think it makes the fundamental difference between understanding programming and not understanding it.</P>


	<P><I>
Well, you might start by writing some code that actually does something, say, recursively iterates over the file system, finds all  MP3  files, extracts the  ID3  tags, and puts them in some sort of simple database.
</I></P>


	<P>My own interest is more on the abstract nature of algorithms rather than the practical details of interacting with the file system or a database. In the end, whether it’s a loop over an array or a loop over the file system, it’s still the same thing – a loop. Sure, I’m well aware that for writing practical code you need all that interaction with the system stuff, but I find that boring detail that doesn’t turn me on.</P>


	<P><I>
Write it in Ruby, then rewrite it in Java, C, or (shudder) Aldwych.
</I></P>


	<P>Why “(shudder) Aldwych”? Have you looked at the language and its aims? Actually it’s some ideas I have for a language, not a fully developed language. Because of that, it doesn’t have the libraries to interact with the real world, just something crude to link to stdin and stdout. The important stuff is the way it represents objects interacting concurrently. And actually in many ways it’s close to Ruby, and it is dynamically typed. I’d appreciate constructive comments.</P>


	<P><I>
I write code when I need to do something, said something rarely being an elegant reimplementation of quicksort or Dijkstra’s algorithm.
</I></P>


	<P>Sure, no-one needs to write code for these things. But I find when I want to assess a new language and how it works, what I do is to write some well-known and understood algorithm in it to see what it looks like.</P>


	<P><I>
Trust me, your students will be far more motivated to write a project that lets them grab (football scores, stock prices, pictures of their favorite actor or musician) from a web site and display them in some cool way than they ever by writing quicksort or the  KMP  string matching algorithm.
</I></P>


	<P>Right, but to do this they’re still going to have to understand basic computational mechanisms, such as loops and assignment and conditionals and passing arguments to methods etc. As recent discussion elsewhere shows, there’s large numbers of guys who have trouble writing code to do “fizzbuzz”, if they haven’t mastered that, how can they do the more complex stuff you suggest which assumes they can do the basics if computing? As it happens, where I teach we DO have a first year course in web programming, which covers scripting languages and grabbing things off the web, so all that stuff isn’t ignored. My job is to teach the algorithms and data structures stuff.</P>


	<P><I>
“Not my cup of tea” is a long way from “horrid”. I think the Poignant Guide is pretty cool, but personally I learned from the Pickaxe book.
</I></P>


	<P>The use of the rather childish word “horrid” was mean to be an indication I wasn’t being entirely serious. But now, to be serious, isn’t one of the most tiresome things, if you’re at university, a lecturer who tries to be funny? Personally I don’t like to be instructed by someone who pads out the facts I want to master with his own sense of humour.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>Dude, no one forced you to be instructed by  WPG2R . You picked it, out of a myriad of publications available, and based a quickly formed (not to mention half baked) opinion  on that, and tried to paint the language with just “exhibit A” (And frankly, the attempts at backpeddalling are a bit awkward now.)</P>

No!! Lecturers who rely on the student’s participation in order to maintain their attention are not very good lecturers at all – in my opinion. As a first year CS undergrad at a respected institute I can tell you right now that my most rewarding classes have been those with teachers who incorporate their own style within their lectures, not those who simply read off their notes – in which case I’ll read the textbook instead. A good laugh every now and again has never hurt anybody.</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>I wouldn’t have mentioned Aldwych at all if it wasn’t for the fact that _lynX must have looked at my home page, picked up on he kludgy way it currently interacts with the outside world, and posted that as if it was what the language was all about. Well, I had to defend it after that. If I ever got as far as releasing the language, quite obviously I’d fix that and put in the Aldwych equivalent to irb, so code to prompt a user to enter two numbers and print their sum would look completely different.</P>


	<P>I’m not claiming Aldwych is a complete language, so obviously it isn’t comparable to Ruby. It’s ideas for a language, just the punctuation really (literally – no key words, just punctuation symbols), and if it were ever to be released as a useable language, it would need the words – a full range of good library code.</P>


	<P>What’s on my home page about it is pretty old and brief as well. I need time to write more down, and I need implementors to work on a better version of it. The one I have compiles down to the Japanese language  KLIC , but I don’t have source code for that, and I need to build my own “core language” rather than use  KLIC  so that I can do more with it to bring the whole thing closer to useability.</P>


	<P>I’ve been trying to get students where I teach to do work developing it as project, but all most students want to do is boring stuff like building a database with a  GUI  front end which works over the web. Yawn, yawn, yawn, where’s the fun in that?</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>No, you’ve jumped two steps here. I’m saying the features of a languages which enable it to interact with a file system or database aren’t of particular interest to me as a person, so that’s not somethng that would turn me on personally to Ruby.

	<P>I think my point is obvious here, but just in case you didn’t get it, I’ll explain again. If students are going to write the code to find all the MP3s on the file system and do something with them, they’re going to have to use loops, conditionals, assignments etc. So aren’t they going to have to be taught these features first before they can use them? That will be the same whatever language they use. When I look at Ruby tutorials – including Why’s – do they start off immediately with a program that finds all the MP3s on the file system and does something with them? No, they start off with the basic syntax and build up. Yours is an interesting suggestion – start off by throwing the students in at the deep end with a fairly complex program that does “real world” stuff and try and teach them from that. And I have seen people who advocate such an approach, and it might work. But not even our hero Why does that, does he?</P>

	<P>Yes, I know that people learn how to write code by writing lots of code. That’s a point I make constantly to my students. The course I teach, though it’s algorithms and data structures, is very code oriented, and I think that’s the right way.</P>


	<P>But your claim that students have come out of school having learnt a lot of abstract stuff about algorithms, but have rarely had to apply that knowledge to solving a real problem is nonsense. Where I teach, and in most other university Computer Science departments, there’s at least one course on web technology, with stuff like picking up files off the web. Most students do final year projects which are very much oriented around this sort of practical stuff. But the “fizzbuzz” debate is actually saying that’s part of the problem – students spend too much of their time rote-memorising library commands to fetch things off the web etc, and not enough time on basic algorithmic and abstract thinking. That is why, when you throw them a problem which involves writing code for a very basic algorithm, they can’t do it.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>As a recent (2004) CS graduate in the UK, I’m quite surprised by your comment that there is the assumption amongst undergrads that aren’t any jobs left out there that are worth doing or haven’t been outsourced.</P>


	<P>After I graduated, I had a development job inside three weeks. I’m still there, and now part of my job responsibilities also include sitting in on interviews. Wow. What a revelation. There are  SO MANY  <B> AWFUL </B> CS graduates, including a lot from ‘decent’ universities. I never thought it possible to graduate from a red brick university with a degree in CS and not ‘get’ m-n relationships in RDBMs.</P>


	<P>This maybe why your students want to study DB based web systems – its where the world works nowadays, and, as I’ve said, there will always be jobs for talented programmers to earn decent wages. Our office is eagerly looking forward to recruitment this year, we have lots of spaces for new nuggets.</P>


	<P>Ability to write complex and fancy algorithms using esoteric research languages like Haskell not required.</P>


	<P>Ability to program in a coherent and logical manner, preferabley with a good knowledge of how a computer works, together with the ability (and yes, I do think its anability, not a skill) to manage memory allocation, an understanding of  RAII  a  DEFINITE  plus.</P>


	<P>I dont mean this as a dig, but you haven’t worked commercially have you? I really think that what CS needs (especially in the UK) is a bit less science, and a bit more BI<STRONG>. You should be teaching these students how to make a career out of their skills.</STRONG></P><STRONG>


	</STRONG><P><STRONG>You do actually raise a decent point in your article about universities setting the bar too low on programming assignments. The answer is to raise the bar.  A LOT . Anyone who doesn’t pass their programming courses over the first year should be encouraged to transfer to a non programming IT speciality –  DBA -orientated course for example. 
Of course, this couldn’t happen, because of that *S</STRONG> part again – its all got to be <STRONG>S</STRONG>cience to academia. Never mind that you turn out substandard ‘programmers’, dont challenge the ones who can actually program remotely well.</P>


	<P>Still, you’ve churned out 200 students a year who  maybe 80% of them couldnt write a program to use a static circular buffer, 70% cant normalise to  BCNF  a relational DB schema and 50% cant write a simple stack. Well done.</P>


	<P>If I divert my attention from lambasting the state of higher education in the UK to Ruby briefly (heh), I think Matz said it best – Ruby is a better Perl. I sneak ruby through the system wherever and whenever I can at work, and I can get away with it because it is ruby. It’s readable, and even the Head of IT can grok a printout of a ruby program and know what its doing. Perl scripts, on the other hand, are invariabley hard to read.</P>


	<P>Perl isnt a write-once language, its just its very damn easy for it to end up that way. I find objectively that ruby groks quite well with my colleagues, compared to the various nasty-ass sh/perl scripts they invariably replace. I can develop quicker in ruby than in perl and it makes me more productive.</P>


	<P>One of the most important things about writing code that adheres to the  POLS  is that you dont write code using obscure, arcane or misleading syntax. Your 2d array example in your article is all of the above. Its a two way street writing code. Make it clear off the bat what is happening and two things happen – you need less documentation of boring internal bits of your code, and your code will forever be readable. I take it you didnt have readability of code as one of your aims with Aldwych.. probably because maintenace of code is not something that academics ever deal with (hey, its research right? Wont need to do that again after I’ve published..)</P>


	<UL>
	<LI>Of course this could rarely happen; you earn far more in the private sector than you do in academia, consequently, who is going to give that up to teach students?</LI>

Without someone around to play Dijkstra, you’re just doing vocational training for one set of products, and with nothing but CS-as-a-branch-of-mathematics folk you’ve got a graduating class more likely to write papers than code.</P>


	<P>I have experienced both extremes.  They are not fun (or usefully educational).  A teaching environment should be able to show the practical kids why theory is important and the math/logic whizzes how to actually implement in a ‘production environment.’</P>


	<P>Similarly, entertainment can be great (though I’d settle for fluency in the human language the class is supposed to be taught in, these days), but matters for little if the information itself is wrong.  There’s a reason many of those Matrix fans can only conceive of evolution as Lamarckian—to ‘engage the audience,’ their science teachers attributed desires and intent to nature, then rushed through the reality of natural selection with population dynamics exercises presented more as math problems than models.</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>You start out wrong,  MMH . There <I>is</I> no Ruby “sales pitch”, that I see. There are Ruby <I>enthusiasts</I> enthusi-izing. Just like there are “Pythonistas” crowing about Python and some guys like me that still feel the most dangerous when slicing through data with Perl.</P>


	<P>Computer Science is the wrong field for this, it has more to do with human behavior. As much as anti-proselytizers would like to get everyone to adopt their behavior and not proselytize – and in turn proselytize for the adopted cause, humans can’t help “sharing” things we’ve found useful. I think it’s the natural behavior that promotes that thing we call “shared knowledge”: “I found something that  works for me, maybe it will help you.”</P>


	<P>The natural complication to this is that a few enthusiasts can over-promise.</P>


	<P>I think the reason why “their supporters have proposed them as general purpose programming languages” is because people <I>are</I> developing what they want with them – just like other general purpose programming languages. Some people like MentalGuy may have hit a wall with them – with regard to parallel programming – but that does not sound that much different from early threads in C++ on a SunOS  SPARC . So, we hit a wall back then as well; you just needed to find a workaround for some things you wanted to do.</P>


	<P>I also think you lumped Why’s book in with other things when it contains this: “So whereas I should probably be pounding your teeth in with hype about Ruby… I will just let you coast. I’ll let you freefall through some code, interjecting occasionally with my own heartfelt experiences. It’ll be quite easy, quite natural.”</P>


	<P>That’s what the book is about. And that’s the way I saw it. Just a weird way to feature code examples and some explanation of how they do what they do. The three reasons he gives to try Ruby is 1) it’s expressive, 2) It’s from Japan, 3) Free. Number 1 does get a little hype-y. Why even uses overstatement here (even identifying it as such), but it does not specifically say that non-programmers will be transmogrified into programmers because of it. I think your major point is about a threshold that most people who are <I>interested</I> in programming – and not just its fruits – don’t think about. And I can relate a personal story about why I think that concerns you and why I think it’s a “professor problem”. 15 years ago, when I was in school, my professors were under the impression that programming was a skill and you could teach anybody. A student—somewhat perceptive – <I>kept</I> telling them that it is a <I>craft</I>, and some people just don’t seem to get it. It looks like tons of studies and 15 years later, profs have now realized what I grasped intuitively. I think the idea that anybody is saying that a language is going to make people with 0-interest or 0-aptitude a programmer is a projection that <I>hobbyists</I> automatically and implicitly exclude. No stereotypical jock who walks around bouncing computer geeks off sidewalks is likely ever going to read what I say about Ruby, Python, or Perl. Thus I might not consider <I>them</I> when I say, “easy to program”. That’s a peculiar and unnecessary injection upon the subject matter.</P>


	<P>I hope I’m not getting too personal to say that your piece almost sounds like frustration with the way that the real world defies academic theories and suppositions: 1) unexpected rise of script languages, 2) not maintained by company hype. 3) Perhaps low popularity of “academic” languages. And 4) upset that “easy” is at times said without qualification – that only concerns a professor anyway. Scripting languages are <I>automatically</I> created and made popular by people who don’t fit that academic category, anyway. One assumes when a language is “popular” it is not as popular as <I>American Idol</I>, so it’s well within reference context to treat “easier” in the same fashion.</P>


	<P>To go a little further, the scripting languages incorporate functional and OO features because they end up <I>solving problems</I>. I’m sure they started out as academic theories, but one can see how they were first theories about how to solve problems. Hybrid languages are created to solve a variety of problems, and solve as many as the language creator can think to put into that language.</P>


	<P>Scripting is about creating real-world solutions fast. Also it’s about increasing the amount of things that a small group of programmers can do in a few lines of code. It solves problems on the line with code-reuse in OO and components – I might suspect – just a different problem.</P></DIV></DIV>

</I></P>


	<P>Why do you say it was a “rant”? I had mentioned in a comment on a previous article in Bitwise magazine that I planned to spend some time looking at Ruby, and he asked me to write an article saying what I thought of it after that. So I did.</P>


	<P>I was actually trying to be balanced, not to rant. I thought the language was ok, and as I said at the end I’d use it in cirucmstances where I feel it’d be useful. But I also thought some of the comments I’ve seen made about it were exaggerated, I didn’t find it as wonderful as other people seem to. On the array addition thing, I didn’t actually say it should be done one way but Ruby does it another, I just used this example to question whether the “principle of least surprise” was quite so obvious as Rubyists claim (by quoting someone else, not that I necessarily agreed with him, for whom this principle would lead to array addition acting differently than it does in Ruby).</P>


	<P>I mentioned features of Ruby which I think might lead to large scale programs written in the language being difficult to maintain in years to come. Is this really such a bad thing to bring into the discussion that it warrants me being accused of being “Soooo damn in love with being right” let alone someone calling for me being fucked in the butt with something sharp? I simply mentioned it as something that concerns me, that’s all. I’m very well aware that there’s a tension which has always existed between “hacking languages” – easy to hack something together, but hairy code that might be hard to work with later – and “strict languages” – more attention to features that would help keep the code in order as it grows, less fun to hack with due to these features.</P>


	<P>One of the things that interest me personally is the idea of a language which is naturally concurrent, where you can have lots of things happening at the same time as each other, and they interact. I think thread and locks on synchronised variables are a very clunky and inelegant way of doing that. One of the reason I see Ruby as not particularly innovative is that it’s still completely sequential with the same concurrency mechanism as in Java etc. I’m interested in languages like Erlang where concurrency is much more neatly handled. So, is it saying that which makes me someone who deserves to be fucked in the butt with something sharp?</P>


	<P>LL – I’ll get back to you later, I have other work to do right now.</P></DIV></DIV>

</I></P>


	<P>So why aren’t Ruby tutorials written like that? Why is there a section which hows a very simple loop first, rather than just a section which shows a loop combined with all the other things required to pick files off a file system and do something to the mp3 ones?</P>

	</I><P><I>LL: So, how much of the code that your students write would you suppose that they ever use again? 
</I></P>


	<P>It’s basic coding techniques, loops and iterators going through a collection to change things, loops and iterators going through a collection to pick out the maximum item in its natural ordering, how you can do the same thing ussing recursion. Describing sorting and showing code for it is a good way of illustrating these basic coding techniques a little further. I think they are going to be using basic coding techniques again if they do coding again.</P>

	<P>You ever tried teaching undergraduates? One of teh biggest problems is that they mistake rote memorisation for learning, ane it’s hard to get them to look beyond the examples to the underlying principles.</P>


	<P><I>
If you ask those guys who can’t solve the fizzbuzz problem what the modulus operator does, I’ll bet every single one of them can tell you. They know the abstract meaning fine. They don’t know the practical implication
</I></P>


	<P>No, the fizzbuzz problem isn’t really about modulus. It’s a problem which involves goig through a collection (the integers) and doing something different depending on different properties of elements of the collection. The fact that the property which is tested involves modulus isn’t the important part of the problem.  So it’s really just another version of the problem  YOU  posed. So what does this show, LL? That  YOU  lack the ability to abstract and generalise, the key property to being a good coder. Bet you spend all your time making minor adjustments to boilerplate code, and think that’s what being a good coder is all about.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>The assumption is among potential undergraduates. Applications for CS degrees have halved since 2000/1. If you ask schools careers advisers why, that’s the answer they give – they don’t think there’s any jobs in it these days.</P>

	<P>Yes, I think that’s true. Part of the problem is the shortage of good applicants, part of the problem is that it’s very hard to tell who’s going to “get it” until you bring them in.

T: This maybe why your students want to study DB based web systems – its where the world works nowadays, and, as I’ve said, there will always be jobs for talented programmers to earn decent wages. Our office is eagerly looking forward to recruitment this year, we have lots of spaces for new nuggets.</I></P><I>


	</I><P><I>Ability to write complex and fancy algorithms using esoteric research languages like Haskell not required
</I></P>


	<P>Sure, I’m not saying that’s not the case. But why don’t you try looking at what’s taught in the universities? I think you’ll find a lot of it is more practical than you suppose. Mine certainly doesn’t have a course on writing complex and fancy algorithms in Haskell. I said I found Haskell “elegant”, I didn’t say I found it practical.</P>


	<P><I>
You do actually raise a decent point in your article about universities setting the bar too low on programming assignments. The answer is to raise the bar.  A LOT  . Anyone who doesn’t pass their programming courses over the first year should be encouraged to transfer to a non programming IT speciality –  DBA  -orientated course for example. Of course, this couldn’t happen, because of that *S part again – its all got to be Science to academia.
</I></P>


	<P>Why don’t you try looking at what is actually taught rather than jump to assumptions? A few top-level CS departments are very theory oriented, Oxford and Cambridge, for example. Most aren’t, not nearly so much as the anti-academic prejudices that are coming out here love to make out.</P>


	<P>Actually, the real reason for not raising the bar higher is that we’re a business. If we failed 80% of our students, we’d be out of a job. Look at all those Chemistry departments that have got closed down. We’re struggling because applications have halved already. Competition for good students and pitching the market right are a lot of what we’re about. It’s a lot more “real world” than manmy suppose.</P>


	<P><I>
I take it you didnt have readability of code as one of your aims with Aldwych.. probably because maintenace of code is not something that academics ever deal with (hey, its research right? Wont need to do that again after I’ve published..)
</I></P>


	<P>Look, why don’t you just  TRY  reading what I wrote? In my original article which sparked all this, one of the points I made about Ruby was that I was concerned it would lead to hard-to-maintain code. And now here I am being accused of not being interested in code maintainability. So this just shows my attackers here are just full of prejudiced hot air – they’ll attack me for one thing, then they’ll attack me for the exact opposite.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>Er, I didn’t say there were objective winners. I said there were problems I could see with Ruby, I also said there were circumstances where I would use it. The article was actually balanced, giving arguments for and against. You accuse me of being closed-minded, I think it;s pretty onvious from the way you jump to conclusions that like most other people posting here,  YOU ’RE the closed-minded ones. “Uggh, he criticised Ruby, he’s an evil fascist boo hiss”.</P>

Maybe “didactic” is another, because I think part of his dislike for the Poignant Guide comes down to the fact that he’s an academic and the Poignant Guide is by an autodidact for other autodidacts

It’s a totally different approach to teach people Ruby and that’s great, because people <STRONG>are</STRONG> different. And the most important thing to consider is, if you don’t like it, you don’t have to read it. There are quite a few Ruby books out there, no one should be offened by <STRONG>why</STRONG>’s effort to make an original one. And an original one it is.</P>


	<P>And the fact remains, that apart from the comic foxes and the weird space stories, how why actually teaches the language makes it really easy to learn Ruby. I used why’s guide as a starting point because the Pickaxe was a bit too hard for me and then I dived into the Pickaxe and had no problems understanding the more complex parts of Ruby any more.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>He just showed, in sattirical genius, that he has a problem with the way you associated his tutorial with Ruby as a whole product and the use of the word “horrid”, which outside the UK has connotations different than those with which you’ve intended to imbue it.</P>

	<P>I also used it, together with other sources, to learn Ruby, because it was fun.</P>


	<P>But _why’s masterpiece is not official Ruby documentation. It is fan art. Would you hate architecture just because you don’t like how Ayn Rand wrote about it in “The Fountainhead”? Would you hate Harry Potter because of the awfully sick tentacle-filled slash fanfics people write about the characters and world it introduced?</P>


	<P>I wouldn’t.</P>

	<P>The only interesting claim regarding ruby itself in this thread was the comparison of Ruby code with Aldwych:</P>


<PRE><CODE>
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name, @age = name, age
  end
  def to_s
    "#{@name} (#{@age})" 
  end
  attr_reader :name, :age
end
</CODE></PRE>

	<P>That’s the way we’d have it in Ruby: it’s more readable than your Aldwych example (which is a good example of golfing in language design,  BTW ). I like the fact that the Ruby code is almost self documenting (to a programmer of any language), whilst the Aldwych code requires a lot of knowledge about language internals. I’m sure, though, that there’s some beautiful magic going on with that Aldwych piece that I would respect had I studied it.</P>


	<P>You can read it and understand what it does.</P>


	<P>But that comparison wasn’t fair: you took a piece of code in one language, with it’s conventions on e.g. how to format data by default, and tried to translate that 1:1 to another language. Ruby also has a default to_s, which we think is fitting the way the language works. How would Aldwych code for the following example look in Aldwich?</P>


<PRE><CODE>
class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name, @age = name, age
  end
  attr_reader :name
  attr_accessor :age
end
</CODE></PRE>

	<P>In Ruby, for cases like your example, we have Struct:</P>


<PRE><CODE>
Struct.new("Person", :name, :age).class_eval(%q{def to_s() "%s (%s)" % [@name, @age]; end}

#ta-da!
</CODE></PRE>

	<P>Don’t forget my question from earlier.</P>


	<P>:)</P>

	<P> PS I  won’t get into the argument about universities and ways to teach code. I have my own opinions and they are completely off topic.</P></DIV></DIV>

to Ruby, you should check out Mr. Neighbourly’s <A href="http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/">Humble LIttle Ruby Book</A> . I was going through the 2nd chapter only yesterday and I gotta tell ya, it cracked me up. I can’t find that particular para, but the book is full of light-hearted humor (and some typos … I’m looking at <EM>you</EM> “Range” section!) Also, it may not have foxes, but it has wombats.. I mean.. if that is your cuppatee..</P>


	<P>Here is an example which made me smile:</P>

		<P>I can hear you saying, “Who cares about that crap?! I need to read a file. I made the
file. I know all that crap about it! Tell me how to read it or I challenge you to a knife
fight, right now, behind the Waffle House! You and me, pal! We’re taking it to the
matresses!” I would like to now kindly respond to your anger with this little tidbit:<CODE>
myfile = File.open("textfile.txt", "r")
myfile.each_line {|line| puts line }
myfile.close

		<P>Why do you say it was a “rant”?</P>

	<P>because it felt like one to me. no deeper reason.</P>


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>some of the comments I’ve seen made about it were exaggerated</P>

	<P>they are. Ruby is no silver bullet. it’s simply, for many people, the best language available.</P>

		<P>I just used this example to question whether the “principle of least surprise” was quite so obvious as Rubyists claim</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>


	<P>matz has commented on this long time ago:</P>


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>Then they come up to me and say, ‘I was surprised by this feature of the language, so Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.’ Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well.</P>

		<P>Is this really such a bad thing to bring into the discussion that it warrants me being accused of being “Soooo damn in love with being right” let alone someone calling for me being fucked in the butt with something sharp?</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>


	<P>no. I’m sorry for (indirectly) calling you stupid. we will get nowhere with this attitude. every community should be judged by how they deal with critic.</P>


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>One of the reason I see Ruby as not particularly innovative is that it’s still completely sequential with the same concurrency mechanism as in Java etc.</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>


	<P>Ruby doesn’t want to be innovative. as I said in another board, it’s <EM>not ahead of its time</EM>, and that’s what makes it strong. Ruby is the language of today, not of tomorrow. and because I live today, I love it.</P>


	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>...concurrency…</P>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>


	<P>I’m sorry, but there are people out there that are not interested in this topic at all ^^ but I understand your attitude now a bit better: Ruby is just a poor lanugage for someone who’s interested in only one aspect of programming languages.</P></DIV></DIV>

	<P>I too was somewhat enraged after reading  MMH ’s article. I’ve since learned that “horrid” isn’t quite as bad for the Brits as it is for us Yanks.</P>


	<P>Still I find it funny how people have the need to fight against perceived “hype” for some open source technology. It is not like Ruby is being sold by someone and therefore hyped for the purpose of making sales. It is hyped because people like it. Are we Ruby fans all mis-guided and brainwashed by Matz? I tend to think not.</P>


	<P>Your article struck me as quite prudish and strict, though maybe that was the style you adopted when writing it. I found your postings here more likable.</P>


	<P>I do agree with you that teaching programming is no easy feat. To me it came naturally so I can’t even relate to those who struggle with it. Though there are certainly skills in my life I’ve struggled to learn that others learned easily.</P>


	<P>I doubt anyone who has used Ruby for any period of time (and is therefore still not steeped in the “Rails Kool-aid”) would disagree that it has flaws. It certainly does. You just didn’t find them in your brief look at the language.</P>

    <DIV class="entryContentOuter"><DIV class="entryContent"><P>The “_Why Way” (hm, I just created a new trend) is what I praise the most for programmers. I write about that a lot at my BalanceOnRails blog for brazilian developers. Yes, programming was born at laboratories and academia but it was a circunstance. The people involved would not call themselves just ‘academics’ but ‘artists’, ‘hackers’. That’s what I see in Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Charles Simonyi, Jef Raskin, Richard Stallman, Bertrand Meyer. Programmers should not limit themselves to pure procedural engineering and production lines. Programming is all about art, taste, delight, fun. We create great stuff out of pure inspiration, not following straight recipes. _Why is, for me, the pinnacle of what I believe every programmer should aspire.</P>
